1,GEORGE W. BUSH,"i have, i have. first question is what’s in the best interests of the united states? what’s in the best interests of our people? when it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. is it in our nation’s interests? peace in the middle east is in our nation’s interests. having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation’s interests. strong relations in europe is in our nation’s interest. i’ve thought a lot about what it means to be the president. i also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so i’ve thought about an administration of people who represent all america, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. i haven’t started naming names except for one person, and that’s mr. richard cheney who i thought did a great job the other night. he’s a vice presidential nominee who represents — i think people got to see why i picked him. he’s man of solid judgment and he’s going to be a person to stand by my side. one of the things i’ve done in texas is i’ve been able to put together a good team of people. i’ve been able to set clear goals. the goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, medicare for our seniors, a social security system that’s safe and secure, foreign policy that’s in our nation’s interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. that’s what a chief executive officer does. so i’ve thought long and hard about the honor of being the president of the united states. ",1,True,Social Welfare,38,4,social security
3,GORE,"yes, jim. i’ve thought a lot about that particular question, and i see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. i see it as a question of values. it is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. and i don’t think that’s just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as americans. it’s really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. as soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they’re wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. so i think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. the power of example is america’s greatest power in the world. and that means, for example, standing up for human rights. it means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they’re having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. so we’ve got to enforce our civil rights laws. we’ve got to deal with things like racial profiling. and we have to keep our military strong. we have the strongest military, and i’ll do whatever is necessary, if i’m president, to make sure that it stays that way. but our real power comes, i think, from our values. ",0,True,Race,40,11,"civil rights, racial"
7,GORE,"i agree with that. i agree with that. i think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that i know about, anyway. that there is some resentment of u.s. power. so i think that the idea of humility is an important one. but i think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. we have to protect our capacity to push forward what america’s all about. that means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. you know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it’s causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. the fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. we need to do more. but the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that america can represent.

65,GORE,"i’d like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. fine. we did, actually, send troops into rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. my wife tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with general sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. but i think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. we could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. but i do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, jim. one of the criteria that i think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. if we tried everything else, if we have allies. in the balkans we have allies, nato, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. in africa we did not. now, we have tried — our country has tried to create an africa crisis response team there, and we’ve met some resistance. we have had some luck with nigeria, but in sierra leon, and now that nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. but because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, i think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but i think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission. ",0,True,National Defense,47,11,"national security, military forces, military forces"
80,GORE,"no, i would make some changes. i think there need to be reforms in the imf. i’ve generally supported it, but i’ve seen them make some calls that i thought were highly questionable. and i think that there’s a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the imf. the world bank i think is generally doing a better job, but i think one of the big issues here that doesn’t get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. the governor mentioned it earlier. i’ve worked on this issue. it’s an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that’s one of the worst forms of it. and we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. i just think, jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. the worldâ€™s coming together, as i said, they’re looking to us. and we have a fundamental choice to make. are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after world war ii, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the united states is going to be the leader. and the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. i think that in the aftermath of the cold war, it’s time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. it means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role. ",0,True,"Economy, Federal Spending",55,11,"economy, surplus"
81,GEORGE W. BUSH,"let me comment on that. i’m not so sure the role of the united states is to go around the world and say this is the way it’s got to be. we can help. and maybe it’s just our difference in government, the way we view government. i want to empower the people. i want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. i just don’t think it’s the role of the united states to walk into a country and say, â€œwe do it this way, so should you.â€ i think we can help. i know we’ve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. but take russia, for example. we went into russia, we said here is some imf money, and it ended up in viktor chemomyrdin’s pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. the only people that are going to reform russia are russia. they’re going to have to make the decision themselves. mr. putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there’s a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. but russia has to make the decision. we can work with them on security matters, for example, but it’s their call to make. so i’m not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but i think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly american is for us to go around the world saying, â€œwe do it this way, so should you.â€ now, we trust freedom. we know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the united states of america, as we saw recently in the balkans. but maybe i misunderstand where you’re coming from, mr. vice president, but i think the united states must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.

85,GORE,"yes, i would. the only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but i would also support a law in the congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. i just — i think that racial profiling is a serious problem. i remember when the stories first came out about the stops in new jersey by the highway patrol there. and i know it’s been going on a long time. in some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. but i have to confess that it was the first time that i really focused on it in a new way. and i was surprised at the extent of it. and i think we’ve now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. imagine what it — what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. now, that runs counter to what the united states of america is all about at our core. and it’s not an easy problem to solve. but if i am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first civil rights act of the 21st century. ",0,True,Race,40,11,"racial, civil rights"
86,GEORGE W. BUSH,"yeah, i can’t imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed. that’s just flat wrong, and that’s not what america is all about. and so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. one of my concerns, though, is i don’t want to federalize the local police forces. i want to — obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. i believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don’t there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. but it’s very important that we not overstep our bounds and i think most people — most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren’t bigoted or aren’t prejudiced. i don’t think they ought to be held guilty. but i do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done. and if you can’t, there will be a federal consequence. ",1,True,Race,40,4,"racial, civil rights, racial"
90,GORE,"i would agree. and i also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. i talked to an african-american police officer in springfield, massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. and not only the training in police procedures, but human relations. and i think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in america. and as for singling people out because of race, you know, james byrd was singled out because of his race in texas. and other americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. and that’s why i think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law. i think these crimes are different. i think they’re different because they’re based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they’re intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people. ",0,True,Race,40,11,"racial, hate crimes"
94,GEORGE W. BUSH,"no. we’ve got one in texas. and guess what? the three men who murdered james byrd, guess what’s going to happen to them? they’re going to be put to death. a jury found them guilty. it’s going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. and it’s the right cause. it’s the right decision. secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in america. arab-americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. people are stopped, and we have to do something about that. my friend, senator spencer abraham of michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that arab-americans are treated with respect. so racial profiling isn’t just an issue at local police forces. it’s an issue throughout our society. and as we become a diverse society, we’re going to have to deal with it more and more. i believe, though — i believe, as sure as i’m sitting here, that most americans really care. they’re tolerant people. they’re good, tolerant people. it’s the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them. ",1,True,Race,40,4,"racial, racial"
96,GEORGE W. BUSH,"let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes. in public education when we just move children through the schools. my friend, phyllis hunter, is here. she had one of the greatest lines of all lines. she said, reading is the new civil right. she’s right. and to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in america must be educated. i mean every child. it starts with making sure every child learns to read. k-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there’s a deficiency. curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. i mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. we can do better in our public schools. we can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, jim. one of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? is anybody being profiled? is anybody being discriminated against? it becomes a tool, a corrective tool. and i believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. and if they are, fine. and if they’re not, there has to be a consequence. and so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. there is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.

105,GEORGE W.

129,GORE,"jim, i hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and i have a very different view than the one he expressed. but that having been said, i believe that — well, first of all, let me say that the governor and i agree on some things where this subject is concerned. i will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. i think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. the problem i see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. i think these assault weapons are a problem. so i favor closing the gun show loophole. in fact, i cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the house of representatives went the other way. that’s still pending. if we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this congress. i think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the brady law. i think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. some of the restrictions that have been placed by the congress in the last couple of years. i think — in the last few years i think have been unfortunate. i think that we ought to make all schools gun free. have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. i think that measures like these are important. child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others. ",0,True,Gun Control,16,11,"gun, assault weapons, gun, gun, gun, gun"
131,GEORGE W. BUSH,"well, it starts with enforcing law. when you say loud and clear to somebody if you’re going to carry a gun illegally, we’re going to arrest you. if you’re going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. if you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. and that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. programs like project exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. and we haven’t done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. and i’m going to make it a priority. secondly, i don’t think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn’t have them. that’s why i support instant background checks at gun shows. one of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. in texas i tried to do something innovative. there’s a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. i support that. but i said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. so we’re distributing in our state of texas for free. i think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. i disagree with the vice president on this issue. he is for registration of guns. i think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license — i guess licensing like a driver’s license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. the criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my i.d. card. it’s the law-abiding citizens who will do that. an i don’t think that is going to be an effective tool to make the — keep our society safe.

343,OBAMA,"now i just want to make one last point because senator mccain mentioned nafta and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. i believe in free trade. but i also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the bush administration with the support of senator mccain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. and nafta doesn’t have — did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. and what i said was we should include those and make them enforceable. in the same way that we should enforce rules against china manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. and when it comes to south korea, we’ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of south korean cars into the united states. that’s all good. we can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into south korea. that is not free trade. we’ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of american businesses and american workers and i make no apology for that.

346,OBAMA,"let me respond. actually, i understand it pretty well. the history in colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions. and what i have said, because the free trade — the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn’t being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, i supported the peruvian free trade agreement which was a well-structured agreement. but i think that the important point is we’ve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries. and the last point i’ll make, because we started on energy. when i talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. they were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. and now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can’t get car loans. that’s why i think it’s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. and detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. it’s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. if we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across america, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.

349,OBAMA,"we’ve got to do both, and that’s exactly what my plan does. look, as i travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. just yesterday, i was in toledo shaking some hands in a line. two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. neither of them have health insurance. and they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they’re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. so here’s what my plan does. if you have health insurance, then you don’t have to do anything. if you’ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. the only thing we’re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. and we estimate we can cut the average family’s premium by about $2,500 per year. if you don’t have health insurance, then what we’re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both senator mccain and i enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. we’re going to make sure that insurance companies can’t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. we’ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. we are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. and we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. we’ve got to put more money into preventive care. this will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it’s also how we’re going to save the federal budget, because we can’t afford these escalating costs.

378,OBAMA,"yes, let me respond to this. if it sounds incredible that i would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that’s because it’s not true. the — here are the facts. there was a bill that was put forward before the illinois senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine roe v. wade. the fact is that there was already a law on the books in illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice republicans and democrats voted against it. and the illinois medical society, the organization of doctors in illinois, voted against it. their hippocratic oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. with respect to partial-birth abortion, i am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there’s an exception for the mother’s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. and i attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. and that was rejected, and that’s why i voted present, because i’m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. the last point i want to make on the issue of abortion. this is an issue that — look, it divides us. and in some ways, it may be difficult to — to reconcile the two views. but there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, “we should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.” those are all things that we put in the democratic platform for the first time this year, and i think that’s where we can find some common ground, because nobody’s pro-abortion. i think it’s always a tragic situation.

390,OBAMA,"well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that’s a tradition that has served us well. but i do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. now we tried to do this under president bush. he put forward no child left behind. unfortunately, they left the money behind for no child left behind. and local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. so what i want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. senator mccain and i actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. charter schools, i doubled the number of charter schools in illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. i think it’s important to foster competition inside the public schools. and we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly — after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can’t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers — give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. and i also have to disagree on senator mccain’s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn’t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can’t give money to every interest group that comes along. i don’t think america’s youth are interest groups, i think they’re our future. and this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. we can’t say we’re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we’re going to pay for it. and if we’re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. it’s not going to happen on its own.

697,TRUMP,"well, one thing i’d do is get rid of carried interest. one of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, i give up a lot when i run, because i knock out the tax code. and she could have done this years ago, by the way. she’s a united states—she was a united states senator. she complains that donald trump took advantage of the tax code. well, why didn’t she change it? why didn’t you change it when you were a senator? the reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that i do. and i do. you have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. but you wouldn’t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on donald trump. but—and i say that about a lot of things. you know, i’ve heard hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. “i wish you would have done this.” but she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff. she never changed. and she never will change. she never will change. we’re getting rid of carried interest provisions. i’m lowering taxes actually, because i think it’s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving—massive corporations and little ones, little ones can’t form. we’re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. but we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. we’re cutting taxes for the middle class. and i will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. and i will tell you, hillary clinton is raising your taxes, folks. you can look at me. she’s raising your taxes really high. and what that’s going to do is a disaster for the country. but she is raising your taxes and i’m lowering your taxes. that in itself is a big difference. we are going to be thriving again. we have no growth in this country. there’s no growth. if china has a gdp of 7 percent, it’s like a national catastrophe. we’re down at 1 percent. and that’s, like, no growth. and we’re going lower, in my opinion. and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. and i’m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. and i think it’s so important—one of the most important things we can do. but she is raising everybody’s taxes massively.

(laughter) this president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. health-care costs for the average american have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. but guess what, america? the wages of americans have gone down. the jobs that are being created in arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we’re losing. and the president just walks on by this problem. the fact is that he’s cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. they only added a little bit back this year because it’s an election year. they’ve cut the pell grants and the perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. they’ve cut the training money. they’ve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. i’m going to do those things, because that’s what’s right in america: help workers to transition in every respect.

1031,GEORGE W. BUSH,"gosh, i sure hope it’s not the administration. there’s a — no, look, there’s a systemic problem. health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. most health-care costs are covered by third parties. and therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. and there’s no market forces involved with health care. it’s one of the reasons i’m a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. these are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. but this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. secondly, i do believe the lawsuits — i don’t believe, i know — that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in america. that’s why i’m such a strong believer in medical liability reform. in the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. well, he didn’t include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. thirdly, one of the reasons why there’s still high cost in medicine is because this is — they don’t use any information technology. it’s like if you looked at the — it’s the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in america. and so, we’ve got to introduce high technology into health care. we’re beginning to do it. we’re changing the language. we want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. people tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it’ll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. and finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. and so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.

1033,KERRY,"the reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs. let me give you a prime example. in the senate we passed the right of americans to import drugs from canada. but the president and his friends took it out in the house, and now you don’t have that right. the president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from canada. we also wanted medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. the va does that. the va provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. we could have done that in medicare. medicare is paid for by the american taxpayer. medicare belongs to you. medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. but rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal — illegal — for medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. that’s a large part of your 17 percent increase in medicare premiums. when i’m president, i’m sending that back to congress and we’re going to get a real prescription drug benefit. now, we also have people sicker because they don’t have health insurance. so whether it’s diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs america more. we got to have health care for all americans.

1039,KERRY,"well, two leading national news networks have both said the president’s characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect. one called it fiction. the other called it untrue. the fact is that my health-care plan, america, is very simple. it gives you the choice. i don’t force you to do anything. it’s not a government plan. the government doesn’t require you to do anything. you choose your doctor. you choose your plan. if you don’t want to take the offer of the plan that i want to put forward, you don’t have do. you can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. but i got a better plan. and i don’t think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. here’s what i do: we take over medicaid children from the states so that every child in america is covered. and in exchange, if the states want to — they’re not forced to, they can choose to — they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. it’s their choice. i think they’ll choose it, because it’s a net plus of $5 billion to them. we allow you — if you choose to, you don’t have to — but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. if it’s good enough for us, it’s good enough for every american. i believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in washington, d. c. you want to buy into it, you can. we give you broader competition. that helps lower prices. in addition to that, we’re going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into medicare early. and most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they’re self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that — for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of america by avoiding surgery and dialysis. it works. and i’m going to offer it to america.

1047,GEORGE W.

1109,BILL CLINTON,"no. there are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class americans are basically the only group of americans who’ve been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down. the wealthiest americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. but my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest americans and getting out of the way. it’s also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can’t tax and divide an economy that isn’t growing. i propose an american version of what works in other countries — i think we can do it better: invest and grow. i believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. invest and grow. raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. this will work. on this, as on so many other issues, i have a fundamental difference from the present administration. i don’t believe trickle down economics will work. unemployment is up. most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. i think we can do better if we have the courage to change.

1117,BILL CLINTON,"i disagree with both of them. for one thing, let me just follow up here. i disagree with mr. perot that the answer is to raise — put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. his own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. and as far as what mr. bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn’t. and just this year, mr. bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. he vetoed middle class tax relief this year. and furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked congress to spend more money than it actually spent. now, it’s hard to out-spend congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. so my view is the middle class is the — they’ve been suffering, jim. now, should people pay more for medicare if they can? yes. should they pay more for social security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they’re upper income people? yes. but look what’s happened to the middle class. middle class americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they’re paying higher taxes. the tax burden on them has not gone down. it has gone up. i don’t think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. the answer is to invest and grow this economy. that’s what works in other countries and that’s what’ll work here.

how can we extend freedom – extend it without war? now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? who threatens freedom in the world? there is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom – that that is presented by the international communist movement. and therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the communists and their leaders. i know mr. khrushchev. i also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other communist leaders in the world. i believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues – principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. first, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. in the seven years before this administration came into power in washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the iron curtain. and at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in korea which cost of thirty thousand american lives. in the past seven years, in president eisenhower’s administration, this situation has been reversed. we ended the korean war; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? i think there’re several reasons. in the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. one of the major errors they made was the one that led to the korean war. in ruling out the defense of korea, they invited aggression in that area. they thought they were going to have peace – it brought war. we learned from their mistakes. and so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. we have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. but we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. that is why president eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to mr. khrushchev at the paris conference, as senator kennedy suggested he could have done. that is why senator wh- president eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the formosa straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations – recommendations which senator kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard – recommendations with regard to – again – slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if – in effect, to the communists. why did the president feel this was wrong and why was the president right and his critics wrong? because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. it encourages them to begin a war. and so i say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. let us move now to the future. it is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical… leaders that the world has ever seen. that is why i say that in this period of the sixties, america must move forward in every area. first of all, although we are today, as senator kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have – if the should launch a surprise attack – we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. they must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. we need this kind of strength because we’re the guardians of the peace. in addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. it has grown in the past seven years. it can and will grow even more in the next four. and the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we’re in a race for survival – a race in which it isn’t enough to be ahead; it isn’t enough simply to be complacent. we have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. and that is why, in this field, i have made recommendations which i am confident will move the american economy ahead – move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the soviet union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. and so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. what are they? again we turn to the past. firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence i mean that we do not answer insult by insult. when you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of mr. khrushchev and his colleagues. and that example that president eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. but all this by itself is not enough. it is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. we must have a great goal. and that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is america’s destiny. to extend it to all the world because the communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend communism. and you cannot fight a victory for communism or a strategy of victory for communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. and so i say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. we also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead america to the victory for freedom – victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries – provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.

1320,MR. KENNEDY,"mr. howe, mr. vice president. first uh – let me again try to correct the record on the matter of quemoy and matsu. i voted for the formosa resolution in 1955. i have sustained it since then. i’ve said that i agree with the administration policy. mr. nixon earlier indicated that he would defend quemoy and matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of china, were not part of a general attack an formosa and the pescadores. i indicated that i would defend those islands if the attack were directed against pescadores and formosa, which is part of the eisenhower policy. i’ve supported that policy. in the last week, as a member of the senate foreign relations committee, i have re-read the testimony of general twining representing the administration in 1959, and the assistant secretary of state before the foreign relations committee in 1958, and i have accurately described the administration policy, and i support it wholeheartedly. so that really isn’t an issue in this campaign. it isn’t an issue with mr. nixon, who now says that he also supports the eisenhower policy. nor is the question that all americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. the question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? is our relative strength growing? is, as mr. nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the communists at an all-time low? i don’t believe it is. i don’t believe that our relative strength is increasing. and i say that not as the democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the united states who is concerned about the united states. i look at cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the united states. in 1957 i was in havana. i talked to the american ambassador there. he said that he was the second most powerful man in cuba. and yet even though ambassador smith and ambassador gardner, both republican ambassadors, both warned of castro, the marxist influences around castro, the communist influences around castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the american government, nothing was done. our d- security depends upon latin america. can any american looking at the situation in latin america feel contented with what’s happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of brazil feels it necessary to call – not on washington during the campaign – but on castro in havana, in order to pick up the support of the castro supporters in brazil? at the american conference – inter-american conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of castro and the cuban communists, we couldn’t even get the inter-american group to join together in denouncing castro. it was rather a vague statement that they finally made. do you know today that the com- the russians broadcast ten times as many programs in spanish to latin america as we do? do you know we don’t have a single program sponsored by our government to cuba – to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? africa is now the emerging area of the world. it contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the general assembly. we didn’t even have a bureau of african affairs until 1957. in the africa south of the sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of thailand. if there’s one thing africa needs it’s technical assistance. and yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. we relied in the middle east on the baghdad pact, and yet when the iraqi government was changed, the baghdad pact broke down. we relied on the eisenhower doctrine for the middle east, which passed the senate. there isn’t one country in the middle east that now endorses the eisenhower doctrine. we look to europe uh – to asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. which system, communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? that’s what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. but are we doing enough in these areas? what are freedom’s chances in those areas? by 1965 or 1970, will there be other cubas in latin america? will guinea and ghana, which have now voted with the communists frequently as newly independent countries of africa – will there be others? will the congo go communist? will other countries? are we doing enough in that area? and what about asia? is india going to win the economic struggle or is china going to win it? who will dominate asia in the next five or ten years? communism? the chinese? or will freedom? the question which we have to decide as americans – are we doing enough today? is our strength and prestige rising? do people want to be identified with us? do they want to follow united states leadership? i don’t think they do, enough. and that’s what concerns me. in africa – these countries that have newly joined the united nations. on the question of admission of red china, only two countries in all of africa voted with us – liberia and the union of south africa. the rest either abstained or voted against us. more countries in asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. i believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. i have seen cuba go to the communists. i have seen communist influence and castro influence rise in latin america. i have seen us ignore africa. there are six countries in africa that are members of the united nations. there isn’t a single american diplomatic representative in any of those six. when guinea became independent, the soviet ambassador showed up that very day. we didn’t recognize them for two months; the american ambassador didn’t show up for nearly eight months. i believe that the world is changing fast. and i don’t think this administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. the average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. the communists say, “come with us; look what we’ve done.” and we’ve been in – on the whole, uninterested. i think we’re going to have to do better. mr. nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. i think we are today. but we were far stronger relative to the communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. they made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. i’m not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. he talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. i agree with him. what we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. and yet, in the last nine months of this year, we’ve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. we’ve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. i look up and see the soviet flag on the moon. the fact is that the state department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the state department has been unwilling to release them. and yet they were polled by the u.s.i.a. the point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we’re engaged. we want peace. we want freedom. we want security. we want to be stronger. we want freedom to gain. but i don’t believe in these changing and revolutionary times this administration has known that the world is changing – has identified itself with that change. i think the communists have been moving with vigor – laos, africa, cuba – all around the world today they’re on the move. i think we have to revita1ize our society. i think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we’re determined in this free country of ours to be first – not first if, and not first but, and not first when – but first. and when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.

1323,MR. KENNEDY,"mr. nixon uh – shows himself i- misinformed. he surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for castro came from the united states, flowed out of florida and other parts of the united states to castro in the mountains. there isn’t any doubt about that, number one. number two, i believe that if any economic sanctions against latin america are going to be successful they have to be multilateral. they have to include the other countries of latin america. the very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on cuba’s economy – i believe castro can replace those markets very easily through latin america, through europe, and through eastern europe. if the united states had stronger prestige and influence in latin america it could persuade – as franklin roosevelt did in 1940 – the countries of latin america to join in an economic quarantine of castro. that’s the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the castro regime – and also the countries of western europe, canada, japan and the others. number three, castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout latin america. the big struggle will be to prevent the influence of castro spreading to other countries – mexico, panama, bolivia, colombia. we’re going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we’re going to prevent castro’s influence from spreading throughout all of latin america. his influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of latin america to join with us in economic quarantine. his influence is growing – mostly because this administration has ignored latin america. you yourself said, mr. vice president, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had castro. why didn’t we?

1331,MR. KENNEDY,"i really don’t need uh – mr. nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen. i’ve served this country for fourteen years in the congress and before that in the service. i’ve just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. what i downgrade, mr. nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. now i didn’t make most of the statements that you said i made. the s- i believe the soviet union is first in outer space. we have – may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest – you yourself said to khrushchev, “you may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we’re ahead of you in color television” in your famous discussion in the kitchen. i think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. secondly, i didn’t say we had the worst slums in the world. i said we had too many slums. and that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this administration has opposed. i didn’t say we had the worst education in the world. what i said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the soviet union and today they’re producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. and fourth, i believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the united nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the united states must come to the conclusion that the united states no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. part of that is because we’ve stood still here at home, because we haven’t met our problems in the united states, because we haven’t had a moving economy. part of that, as the gallup polls show, is because the soviet union made a breakthrough in outer space. mr. george allen, head of your information service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. we’re first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we’re not first.

1341,MR. KENNEDY,"one of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is – i have felt, has been eastern europe. i’ve been critical of the administration’s failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the hungarian revolution. we indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. but there was a period there when poland demonstrated a national independence and even the polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the soviet union. i suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. we received the support first of the administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the senate. we passed the bill in the senate this year but it didn’t pass the house. i would say eastern europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh – s- of the soviet union. secondly, the relations between russia and china. they are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. no one can say what that course of action will be, but i think the next president of the united states should watch it carefully. if those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. thirdly, i believe that india represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. india started from about the same place that china did. chinese communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. india under a free society has been making some progress. but if india does not succeed – with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can’t make freedom work – then people around the world are going to determine – particularly in the underdeveloped world – that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the communist system. fourth, let me say that in africa, asia, latin america, eastern europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. this has expressed itself in the revolts in eastern europe. it’s expressed itself in the desire of the people of africa to be independent of western europe. they want to be free. and my judgment is that they don’t want to give their freedom up to become communists. they want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the communists. and i believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as lincoln, as wilson did, as franklin roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, i believe in latin america, africa, and asia, eventually in the eastern europe and the middle east, certainly in western europe, we can strengthen freedom. we can make it move. we can put the communists on the defensive.

1343,MR.

1788,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I’m trying to do is increase our exports. And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven’t done that. And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement — and the prime minister of Canada, I might add — and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas. That’s a scare tactic, because it’s not that many. But any one that’s here, we want to have more jobs here. And the way to do that is to increase our exports. Some believe in protection. I don’t; I believe in free and fair trade, and that’s the thing that saved us. So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly. I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year. I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile. And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection. And, as I say, we’ve had tough economic times, and it’s exports that have saved us, exports that have built. ",1,True,Economy,25,8,more jobs
1790,BILL CLINTON,"I’d like to answer the question, because I’ve actually been a governor for 12 years, so I’ve known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports. The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us. It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it’s also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan. So what is the answer? Let me just mention three things very quickly. Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they’re not, have measures on the books that don’t take forever and a day to implement. Number two, change the tax code. There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here. Our competitors don’t do that. Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas. Number three, stop the federal government’s program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won’t do the same thing for plants that stay here. So more trade but on fair terms — and favor investment in America. ",0,True,Federal Spending,29,1,"deficit, deficit"
1793,BILL CLINTON,"No, and here’s why. And I’ll tell you exactly why. Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years. I’ll tell you exactly what I think can be done. I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy. Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you’d have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse. Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years. So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy. I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you’ve got to go. If you don’t grow the economy you can’t get it done. But I can’t foresee all the things that will happen, and I don’t think a president should be judged solely on the deficit. Let me also say, we’re having an election today. You’ll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I’ve done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.

1795,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Well, I’m a little confused here, because I don’t see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people’s taxes. You see, I don’t think the American people are taxed too little. I think they’re taxed too much. I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it. I said that wasn’t the right thing to do. Governor Clinton’s program wants to tax more and spend more — $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220. I don’t believe that’s the way to do it. Here’s some thing that’ll help. Give us a balanced budget amendment. He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment. Have to do it. I’d like the government to have that. And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch. I’d like to have what 43 governors have — the line item veto, so if the Congress can’t cut, and we’ve got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature. I’ve proposed another one. Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky. I think it’s good. It’s a check- off. It says to you as a taxpayer — say you’re going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something. You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you’re paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount. And if the Congress won’t do it, if they can’t get together and negotiate how to do that, then you’d have a sequester across the board. You’d exempt Social Security — I don’t want to tax or touch Social Security. I’m the president that said hey, don’t mess with Social Security, and we haven’t. So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman’s question. That’s the main growing thing in the budget. The program that the president — two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch. We’ve got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now. I just don’t believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.

1805,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president. I think you have to look at it. I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president. In terms of programs, I’ve submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail. It’s so heavy they’d give you a broken back. And everything in there says what I am for. Now I’ve come out with a new agenda for America’s renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy. My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I’ve been president for 4 years, so I feel I’ve been talking issues. You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I’m not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I’m going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here’s my side of it. But character is an important part of the equation. The other night Governor Clinton raised my — I don’t know if you saw the debate the other night. You did — suffered through that? Well, he raised the question of my father — it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered. But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism. I remember something my dad told me — I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother — which I faithfully did; he said serve your country — my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth. And I’ve tried to do that in public life, all through it. That says something about character. My argument with Governor Clinton — you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it’s fair to put it in focus is — I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country’s at war. Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me. But that’s what I feel. That’s what I feel passionately about. I’m thinking of Ross Perot’s running mate sitting in the jail. How would he feel about it? But maybe that’s generational. I don’t know. But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues — trying to be one thing to one person here that’s opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it — what we call waffling.

1843,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"I’m not sure that — and I can understand if you haven’t seen this, because there’s been a lot of hue and cry. We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways — $150 billion for improving the infrastructure. That happened when I was president. And so I’m very proud of the way that came about and I think it’s a very, very good beginning. Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it’s awful hard to say we’re going to go out and spend more money when we’re trying to get the deficit down. But I would cite that as a major accomplishment. We hear all the negatives. When you’re president you expect this. Everybody’s running against the incumbent. They can do better. Everyone knows that. But here’s something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you’re talking about. Our home initiative — our home ownership initiative — HOPE — that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements. Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city. There’s a good program. And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress. When we went out to south central in Los Angeles — some of you may remember the riots there. I went out there. I went to a boys’ club. And everyone of them — the boys’ club leaders, the ministers — all of them were saying pass enterprise zones. We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress. But there’s going to be a new Congress. No one likes gridlock. There’s going to be a new Congress because the old one — I don’t want to get this man made at me — but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal. You’re going to have a lot of new members of Congress. And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities. Help me pass these programs. ",1,True,Federal Spending,29,8,deficit
1847,BILL CLINTON,"That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. And that’s why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year. This is not mud slinging. This is fact slinging — a bill earlier this year. This is facts — that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country. But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that. But let me tell you specifically what my plan does. My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century. And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs. There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs. They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail. They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind. We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we’re going to lose in defense — if we target it. But we’re investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it. It’s making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.

1859,BILL CLINTON,"I support the right to keep and bear arms. I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they’re sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you don’t have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check. I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill. We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up. The third thing I would say — it doesn’t bear directly on gun control, but it’s very important — we need more police on the street. There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it’s a shame it didn’t pass, I think it should be made the law — but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period. I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers. Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer. In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you’ve seen crime go down. In Houston there’s been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force. So I know it can work; I’ve seen it happen.

I talk about strengthening the American family and it’s very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread. It’s very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation — habeas corpus reform, so you don’t have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I’ve been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn’t go away. I’ll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers. Virginia’s in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms. I am not for national registration of firearms. Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime. I am for the right, as the governor says- -I’m a sportsman and I don’t think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons. But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal. I’m very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I’m trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation. We’ve got more money going out for local police than any previous administration. So we’ve got to get it under control and there’s one last point I’d make. Drugs. We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs. And we’re making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction. We’re not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users. The good news is, and I think it’s true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.

1879,BILL CLINTON,"I’ve had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America — you know, people who’ve lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children. So let me try to answer you in this way. Let’s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all — and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years. So if you analyze where we’re out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions. Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn’t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed. Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can’t keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I’ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn’t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care. The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality. To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be — I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth. Now, let me say, some people say we can’t do this but Hawaii does it. They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country. This is very important. It’s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I’m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency. It’s terribly important.

I don’t want anybody to stampede to cut the president’s salary off altogether. Barbara’s sitting over here and I — but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done. She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame. No. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits. They’re breaking the system. It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped. Doctors don’t dare to deliver babies sometimes because they’re afraid that somebody’s going to sue them. People don’t dare — medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they’re afraid that some lawyer’s going to come along and get a big lawsuit. So you can’t blame the practitioners for the health problem. And my program is this. Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance. A great big company can buy — Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful. He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop’s store on the corner. But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down. So I want to keep the quality of health care. That means keep government out of it.

1884,BILL CLINTON,"One brief point. We have elections so people can make decisions about this. The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it. They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care So I ask you to look at that. And you have to vote for somebody with a plan. That’s what you have elections for. If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I’m going to do it.

1961,DUKAKIS,"yes, i’ve been very specific about those, john. and let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that’s balanced ten budgets in a row, i’ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. first, i’ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don’t need and we can’t afford. mr. bush has been critical of me for that, but i think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. i’ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and i’ve outlined those in detail. secondly, we’ve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the congress for bringing that deficit down. and, finally, we’ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren’t being paid to this country. it’s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. i’ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. we ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we’ve been doing under this administration. we can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. the thing i don’t understand about mr. bush’s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. he seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he’s against new taxes, although he’s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that i know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. he also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. if he keeps this up, he’s going to be the joe isuzu of american politics.

2147,MR.

2223,MCCAIN,"well — well, let me give you an example of what senator obama finds objectionable, the business tax. right now, in the united states of america, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. ireland pays 11 percent. now, if you’re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it’s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you’re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. i want to cut that business tax. i want to cut it so that businesses will remain in — in the united states of america and create jobs. but, again, i want to return. it’s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. i can tell you, it’s rife. it’s throughout. the united states senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 — 2,000 — look at them, my friends. look at them. you’ll be appalled. and senator obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. so the point is, i want people to have tax cuts. i want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. i want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in america. i know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in senator obama’s definition of “rich.” ",1,True,"Economy, Health Care",14,6,"businesses, health care"

2288,OBAMA,"jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. first of all, let’s talk about this troop funding issue because john always brings this up. senator mccain cut — senator mccain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn’t believe in a timetable. i opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to george bush. we had a difference on the timetable. we didn’t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. we had a legitimate difference, and i absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. and the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. the question is, was this wise? we have seen afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. we need more troops there. we need more resources there. senator mccain, in the rush to go into iraq, said, you know what? we’ve been successful in afghanistan. there is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. this is a time when bin laden was still out, and now they’ve reconstituted themselves. secretary of defense robert gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in afghanistan and it needs to end there. but we can’t do it if we are not willing to give iraq back its country. now, what i’ve said is we should end this war responsibly. we should do it in phases. but in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put — provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin laden and crush al qaeda. and right now, the commanders in afghanistan, as well as admiral mullen, have acknowledged that we don’t have enough troops to deal with afghanistan because we still have more troops in iraq than we did before the surge.

2341,OBAMA,"no, actually, i think senator mccain and i agree for the most part on these issues. obviously, i disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to russians going into georgia. i immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. and, absolutely, i wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on georgia, and that’s why i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. because part of russia’s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where president saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that putin favored more. two points i think are important to think about when it comes to russia. number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. so back in april, i warned the administration that you had russian peacekeepers in georgian territory. that made no sense whatsoever. and what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. that wasn’t done. but had it been done, it’s possible we could have avoided the issue. the second point i want to make is — is the issue of energy. russia is in part resurgent and putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as senator mccain mentioned. that means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil — 25 percent of the world’s oil — have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we’ve talked about, iran, venezuela. and that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world’s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. so we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem. what we’re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. and, you know, i’ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. and i have to say, senator mccain and i, i think agree on the importance of energy, but senator mccain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. over 26 years, senator mccain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. and so we — we — we’ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winter’s coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that’s so important.

2404,OBAMA,"well, senator mccain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why i suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. and he’s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn’t the case with me. but let’s be clear: earmarks account for $18 billion in last year’s budget. senator mccain is proposing — and this is a fundamental difference between us — $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. and in his tax plan, you would have ceos of fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million americans out. so my attitude is, we’ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. what i’ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. and that means that the ordinary american out there who’s collecting a paycheck every day, they’ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. and over time, that, i think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the — the policies of president bush that john mccain wants to — wants to follow.

2477,OBAMA,"jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. first of all, let’s talk about this troop funding issue because john always brings this up. senator mccain cut — senator mccain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn’t believe in a timetable. i opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to george bush. we had a difference on the timetable. we didn’t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. we had a legitimate difference, and i absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. and the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. the question is, was this wise? we have seen afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. we need more troops there. we need more resources there. senator mccain, in the rush to go into iraq, said, you know what? we’ve been successful in afghanistan. there is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. this is a time when bin laden was still out, and now they’ve reconstituted themselves. secretary of defense robert gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in afghanistan and it needs to end there. but we can’t do it if we are not willing to give iraq back its country. now, what i’ve said is we should end this war responsibly. we should do it in phases. but in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put — provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin laden and crush al qaeda. and right now, the commanders in afghanistan, as well as admiral mullen, have acknowledged that we don’t have enough troops to deal with afghanistan because we still have more troops in iraq than we did before the surge. ",0,True,National Defense,47,12,"more troops, more troops"
2487,OBAMA,"yes, i think we need more troops. i’ve been saying that for over a year now. and i think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it’s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. we had the highest fatalities among u.s. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. and we are seeing a major offensive taking place — al qaida and taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. they are feeling emboldened. and we cannot separate afghanistan from iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don’t have the troops right now to deal with afghanistan. so i would send two to three additional brigades to afghanistan. now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no al qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in afghanistan. and that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that al qaida is the greatest threat against the united states and that secretary of defense gates acknowledged the central front — that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in afghanistan and in pakistan. so here’s what we have to do comprehensively, though. it’s not just more troops. we have to press the afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. and i’ve said this to president karzai. number two, we’ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. number three, we’ve got to deal with pakistan, because al qaida and the taliban have safe havens in pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under george bush, with the support of senator mccain, we’ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. and until we do, americans here at home are not going to be safe.

2489,MCCAIN,"first of all, i won’t repeat the mistake that i regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the afghan freedom fighters and drive the russians out of afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. and the result over time was the taliban, al qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. so we can’t ignore those lessons of history. now, on this issue of aiding pakistan, if you’re going to aim a gun at somebody, george shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you’d better be prepared to pull the trigger. i’m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to pakistan. so i’m not prepared to threaten it, as senator obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into pakistan. we’ve got to get the support of the people of — of pakistan. he said that he would launch military strikes into pakistan. now, you don’t do that. you don’t say that out loud. if you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the pakistani government. now, the new president of pakistan, kardari (sic), has got his hands full. and this area on the border has not been governed since the days of alexander the great. i’ve been to waziristan. i can see how tough that terrain is. it’s ruled by a handful of tribes. and, yes, senator obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn’t understand, it’s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in iraq. it’s going to have to be employed in afghanistan. and we’re going to have to help the pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. and it’s going to be tough. they’ve intermarried with al qaida and the taliban. and it’s going to be tough. but we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. and the pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the marriott hotel in islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don’t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the taliban and jihadist elements. so we’ve got a lot of work to do in afghanistan. but i’m confident, now that general petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops — and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. so it’s not just the addition of troops that matters. it’s a strategy that will succeed. and pakistan is a very important element in this. and i know how to work with them. and i guarantee you i would not publicly state that i’m going to attack them.

2525,OBAMA,"well, i think that, given what’s happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. their actions in georgia were unacceptable. they were unwarranted. and at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party — or the six-point cease-fire. they have to remove themselves from south ossetia and abkhazia. it is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. and we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the estonians, the lithuanians, the latvians, the poles, the czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. they are members of nato. and to countries like georgia and the ukraine, i think we have to insist that they are free to join nato if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. now, we also can’t return to a cold war posture with respect to russia. it’s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. one is nuclear proliferation. they have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they’ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of al qaida. this is an area where i’ve led on in the senate, working with a republican ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee, dick lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. that’s an area where we’re going to have to work with russia. but we have to have a president who is clear that you don’t deal with russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. you deal with russia based on, what are your — what are the national security interests of the united states of america? and we have to recognize that the way they’ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.

2530,OBAMA,"no, actually, i think senator mccain and i agree for the most part on these issues. obviously, i disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to russians going into georgia. i immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. and, absolutely, i wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on georgia, and that’s why i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. because part of russia’s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where president saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that putin favored more. two points i think are important to think about when it comes to russia. number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. so back in april, i warned the administration that you had russian peacekeepers in georgian territory. that made no sense whatsoever. and what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. that wasn’t done. but had it been done, it’s possible we could have avoided the issue. the second point i want to make is — is the issue of energy. russia is in part resurgent and putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as senator mccain mentioned. that means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil — 25 percent of the world’s oil — have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we’ve talked about, iran, venezuela. and that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world’s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. so we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem. what we’re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. and, you know, i’ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. and i have to say, senator mccain and i, i think agree on the importance of energy, but senator mccain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. over 26 years, senator mccain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. and so we — we — we’ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winter’s coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that’s so important.

America has a lot of families that are in trouble today. There’s been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign. I know a lot about that. I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents. I’ve seen the family values of my people in Arkansas. I’ve seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that’s had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America’s families, whether they’re people on welfare you’re trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they’ve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.

The president’s got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years. But if you don’t have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you can’t fix this problem. Costs will continue to spiral. And just remember this, folks. A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine. I’ve met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire. All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine. So let’s be careful.

I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don’t think we need to touch Social Security. What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs. And Ross properly says, okay, there’s some pain in that. But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses. So what we’ve got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line. And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it’s Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.

Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race. I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care. I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare. Look what’s happened. The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid — we’ve done it in Arkansas under budget pressures. But what happens? More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases. If you don’t control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it. Look at our program. We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government. We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states. And we control private and public health care costs. Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats — more Republicans than Democrats — said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade. I’ve got a plan to control health care costs. But you can’t just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies. And you have to have cost controls, yes. But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care. The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.

I’d like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America. I’d like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change. I’d like to thank the people who’ve started with Mr. Perot who’ve come on to help our campaign. I’d like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about — the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change. This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America — the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse. Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don’t quite square with the record. He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn’t been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn’t say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break — but he vetoed it anyway. I offer a new direction. Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again. I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.

2628,OBAMA,"and what i want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we’ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. and there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. number one, i want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. now when governor romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt. i said we’re going to bet on american workers and the american auto industry and it’s come surging back. i want to do that in industries, not just in detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we’re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the united states and creating jobs here. it also means we’re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. number two, we’ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. and the fact that you’re going to college is great, but i want everybody to get a great education and we’ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but i also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. number three, we’ve got to control our own energy. now, not only oil and natural gas, which we’ve been investing in; but also, we’ve got to make sure we’re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. that’s why we’ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. we’ve got to reduce our deficit, but we’ve got to do it in a balanced way. asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. and let’s take the money that we’ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild america, roads, bridges schools. we do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but america’s future is going to bright as well.

2630,ROMNEY,"well what you’re seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job. and a lot of them, as you say, candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. the president’s policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven’t put americans back to work. we have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office. if the — the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it’s 7.8 percent now. but if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. we have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. that’s why i put out a five-point plan that gets america 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay. it’s going to help jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. it’s going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now. and one thing that the president said, which i want to make sure that we understand, he said that i said we should take detroit bankrupt. and that’s right. my plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-eleven did and macy’s and condell (ph) airlines and come out stronger. and i know he keeps saying, you want to take detroit bankrupt. well, the president took detroit bankrupt. you took general motors bankrupt. you took chrysler bankrupt. so when you say that i wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. and i think it’s important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. that was precisely what i recommended and ultimately what happened. ",1,True,Economy,25,7,"unemployment, unemployment"
2641,OBAMA,"the most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. so here’s what i’ve done since i’ve been president. we have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. natural gas production is the highest it’s been in decades. we have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. but what i’ve also said is we can’t just produce traditional source of energy. we’ve also got to look to the future. that’s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. that means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you’re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. that’s why we doubled clean — clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. and all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. now, i want to build on that. and that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. we continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. we’ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. and we can do it in an environmentally sound way. but we’ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that’s how we’re going to reduce demand and that’s what’s going to keep gas prices lower. now, governor romney will say he’s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. so he’s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn’t have the clean energy part. and if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we’re not going to control our own economic future. because china, germany, they’re making these investments. and i’m not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. i expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the united states. that’s going to help jeremy get a job. it’s also going to make sure that you’re not paying as much for gas. ",0,True,Oil Industry,62,12,"oil, oil, oil imports, gas prices, oil, oil"
2643,ROMNEY,"well, let’s look at the president’s policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we’ve had four years of policies being played out. and the president’s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. as a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. why? because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. so where’d the increase come from? well a lot of it came from the bakken range in north dakota. what was his participation there? the administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. and what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. look, i want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. i believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. but what we don’t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. this has not been mr. oil, or mr. gas, or mr. coal. talk to the people that are working in those industries. i was in coal country. people grabbed my arms and said, “please save my job.” the head of the epa said, “you can’t build a coal plant. you’ll virtually — it’s virtually impossible given our regulations.” when the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you’ll go bankrupt. that’s not the right course for america. let’s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. and if we do that, if we do what i’m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, north america energy independence within eight years, you’re going to see manufacturing jobs come back. because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. i’ll get america and north america energy independent. i’ll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. we’re going to bring that pipeline in from canada. how in the world the president said no to that pipeline? i will never know. this is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of america, and that’s what i’m going to do.

",1,True,Oil Industry,62,7,oil
2677,ROMNEY,"that was a statement. i don’t think the american people believe that. i will fight for oil, coal and natural gas. and the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you’re paying at the pump. if you’re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. but you’re paying more. when the president took office, the price of gasoline here in nassau county was about $1.86 a gallon. now, it’s $4.00 a gallon. the price of electricity is up. if the president’s energy policies are working, you’re going to see the cost of energy come down. i will fight to create more energy in this country, to get america energy secure. and part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in alaska, drilling offshore in virginia where the people want it. those things will get us the energy we need. ",1,True,Oil Industry,62,7,"oil, oil, oil"
2679,OBAMA,"well, think about what the governor — think about what the governor just said. he said when i took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. why is that? because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the great depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that governor romney’s now promoting. so, it’s conceivable that governor romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess. what i want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy. and with respect to this pipeline that governor romney keeps on talking about, we’ve — we’ve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once. so, i’m all for pipelines. i’m all for oil production. what i’m not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. so, for example, on wind energy, when governor romney says “these are imaginary jobs.” when you’ve got thousands of people right now in iowa, right now in colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the republican senator in that — in iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and governor romney says i’m opposed. i’d get rid of it. that’s not an energy strategy for the future. and we need to win that future. and i intend to win it as president of the united states.

2702,ROMNEY,"thank you very much. and let me tell you, you’re absolutely right about part of that, which is i want to bring the rates down, i want to simplify the tax code, and i want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes. and the reason i want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. you’ve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. health insurance premiums, up $2,500. food prices up. utility prices up. the middle-income families in america have been crushed over the last four years. so i want to get some relief to middle-income families. that’s part — that’s part one. now, how about deductions? ‘cause i’m going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but i’m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because i am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they’re paying now. the top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. so that’ll stay the same. middle-income people are going to get a tax break. and so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets — i’ll pick a number — $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions. but your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. no tax on your savings. that makes life a lot easier. if you’re getting interest from a bank, if you’re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don’t have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there’ll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains. why am i lowering taxes on the middle-class? because under the last four years, they’ve been buried. and i want to help people in the middle-class. and i will not — i will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. and i will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. the president’s spending, the president’s borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the american people. not just at the high end. a recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. i will not let that happen. i want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and i’m going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. and what’s that going to do? it’s going to help those families, and it’s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country. ",1,True,Health Care,15,7,health insurance
2704,OBAMA,"my philosophy on taxes has been simple. and that is, i want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. because they have been hit hard over the last decade. over the last 15, over the last 20 years. so four years ago i stood on a stage just like this one. actually it was a town hall, and i said i would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that’s what i’ve done, by $3,600.00. i said i would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. and we’ve cut them 18 times. and i want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. but what i’ve also said is, if we’re serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we’ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. so what i’ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. and that means 98 percent of american families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. i’m ready to sign that bill right now. the only reason it’s not happening is because governor romney’s allies in congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. but what i’ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when bill clinton was president. we created 23 million new jobs. that’s part of what took us from deficits to surplus. it will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. now, governor romney has a different philosophy. he was on 60 minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? and he said, “yes, i think that’s fair.” not only that, he said, “i think that’s what grows the economy.” well, i fundamentally disagree with that. i think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. i think that grows the economy. i think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. that grows our economy. so we just have a different theory. and when governor romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a republican primary he stood on stage and said “i’m going to give tax cuts” — he didn’t say tax rate cuts, he said “tax cuts to everybody,” including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that’s been his history. and that’s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that’s striving for everybody.

2706,ROMNEY,"you’re absolutely right. you heard what i said about my tax plan. the top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. i’m not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. i am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people. and why do i want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end? because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people. and for me, this is about jobs. i want to get america’s economy going again. fifty-four percent of america’s workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. so when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people. for me, i look at what’s happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment. we can do better than this. we don’t have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million americans struggling to find a good job right now. there are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office. we don’t have to live like this. we can get this economy going again. my five-point plan does it. energy independence for north america in five years. opening up more trade, particularly in latin america. cracking down on china when they cheat. getting us to a balanced budget. fixing our training programs for our workers. and finally, championing small business. i want to make small businesses grow and thrive. i know how to make that happen. i spent my life in the private sector. i know why jobs come and why they go. and they’re going now because of the policies of this administration.

2708,OBAMA,"no, it’s not settled. look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent. along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion. governor romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military’s not asking for them. that’s $7 trillion. he also wants to continue the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans. that’s another trillion dollars — that’s $8 trillion. now, what he says is he’s going to make sure that this doesn’t add to the deficit and he’s going to cut middleclass taxes. but when he’s asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close? he can’t tell you. the — the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher. he’s already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we — we’re not going to get money that way. we haven’t heard from the governor any specifics beyond big bird and eliminating funding for planned parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. now, governor romney was a very successful investor. if somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, here, i want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we’re going to pay for it, but we can’t tell you until maybe after the election how we’re going to do it, you wouldn’t take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the american people, because the math doesn’t add up. and — and what’s at stake here is one of two things, either candy — this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he’s talking about, $7 trillion – $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have. or, alternatively, it’s got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that — that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates. you’re going to be paying for it. you’re going to lose some deductions, and you can’t buy the sales pitch. nobody who’s looked at it that’s serious, actually believes it adds up.

2723,ROMNEY,"and — and so we — we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. i went to a number of women’s groups and said, “can you help us find folks,” and they brought us whole binders full of women. i was proud of the fact that after i staffed my cabinet and my senior staff, that the university of new york in albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in america. now one of the reasons i was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort. but number two, because i recognized that if you’re going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. my chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. she said, i can’t be here until 7 or 8 o’clock at night. i need to be able to get home at 5 o’clock so i can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. so we said fine. let’s have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. we’re going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy i’m going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they’re going to be anxious to hire women. in the — in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. that’s the net of what’s happened in the last four years. we’re still down 580,000 jobs. i mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago. what we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. this is what i have done. it’s what i look forward to doing and i know what it takes to make an economy work, and i know what a working economy looks like. and an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. an economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. an economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can’t finds a job, or a college level job, that’s not what we have to have.

2727,OBAMA,"katherine, i just want to point out that when governor romney’s campaign was asked about the lilly ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? he said, “i’ll get back to you.” and that’s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace. for example, their healthcare. you know a major difference in this campaign is that governor romney feels comfortable having politicians in washington decide the health care choices that women are making. i think that’s a mistake. in my health care bill, i said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. because this is not just a — a health issue, it’s an economic issue for women. it makes a difference. this is money out of that family’s pocket. governor romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. that’s not the kind of advocacy that women need. when governor romney says that we should eliminate funding for planned parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on planned parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. that’s a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country. and it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. when we talk about child care, and the credits that we’re providing. that makes a difference in whether they can go out there and — and earn a living for their family. these are not just women’s issues. these are family issues. these are economic issues. and one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.

2740,ROMNEY,"let me come back and — and answer your question. president bush and i are — are different people and these are different times and that’s why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. i mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in north america without having to go to the — the arabs or the venezuelans or anyone else. that wasn’t true in his time, that’s why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in north america — become energy secure. number two, trade — i’ll crack down on china, president bush didn’t. i’m also going to dramatically expand trade in latin america. it’s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. i want to add more free trade agreements so we’ll have more trade. number three, i’m going to get us to a balanced budget. president bush didn’t. president obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the bush years. he was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. and his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. so that’s the next area i’m different than president bush. and then let’s take the last one, championing small business. our party has been focused too long. i came through small business. i understand how hard it is to start a small business. that’s why everything i’ll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. i want to keep their taxes down on small business. i want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. and the thing i find the most troubling about obama care, well it’s a long list, but one of the things i find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. my priority is jobs. i know how to make that happen. and president bush has a very different path for a very different time. my path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people. ",1,True,Economy,25,7,"small businesses, businesses, small businesses, businesses, small businesses, businesses"
2742,OBAMA,"well, first of all, i think it’s important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. we were losing 800,000 jobs a month when i started. but we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well. now, we’ve seen 30 consecutive — 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created. and the plans that i talked about will create even more. but when governor romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. that’s what took us from surplus to deficit. when he talks about getting tough on china, keep in mind that governor romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to china, and is currently investing in countries — in companies that are building surveillance equipment for china to spy on its own folks. that’s — governor, you’re the last person who’s going to get tough on china. and what we’ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we’ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of american workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. we’ve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we’ve won every single one that’s been decided. when i said that we had to make sure that china was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, governor romney said i was being protectionist; that it wouldn’t be helpful to american workers. well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. and that’s the kind of tough trade actions that are required. but the last point i want to make is this. you know, there are some things where governor romney is different from george bush. george bush didn’t propose turning medicare into a voucher. george bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. he didn’t call for self-deportation. george bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for planned parenthood, so there are differences between governor romney and george bush, but they’re not on economic policy. in some ways, he’s gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. and i think that’s a mistake. that’s not how we’re going to move our economy forward.

2765,ROMNEY,"thank you. lorraine? did i get that right? good. thank you for your question. and let me step back and tell you what i would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. but first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. we welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. my dad was born in mexico of american parents; ann’s dad was born in wales and is a first-generation american. we welcome legal immigrants into this country. i want our legal system to work better. i want it to be streamlined. i want it to be clearer. i don’t think you have to — shouldn’t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. i also think that we should give visas to people — green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. people around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the u.s. of a. we should make sure our legal system works. number two, we’re going to have to stop illegal immigration. there are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. those who’ve come here illegally take their place. so i will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. what i will do is i’ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. i won’t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. so for instance, i would not give driver’s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. the kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, i think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the united states and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.

2867,ROMNEY,"boy, great question and important question, because you’re absolutely right. the place where we’ve seen manufacturing go has been china. china is now the largest manufacturer in the world. it used to be the united states of america. a lot of good people have lost jobs. a half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. that’s total over the last four years. one of the reasons for that is that people think it’s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. we have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. what i will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to america again. this is the way we’re going to create jobs in this country. it’s not by trickle-down government, saying we’re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. i want to make america the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in america. now, we’re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. and china hasn’t. one of the reasons — or one of the ways they don’t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. we lose sales. and manufacturers here in the u.s. making the same products can’t compete. china has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. and the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. on day one, i will label china a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where i believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. so we’re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. but let me — let me not just stop there. don’t forget, what’s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and i’m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they — they follow the law and play by the rules, but it’s also to make america the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. that’s why i want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. ours is 35 percent. so if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? we have to be competitive if we’re going to create more jobs here. regulations have quadrupled. the rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. i talk to small businesses across the country. they say, “we feel like we’re under attack from our own government.” i want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. and there’s no question but that obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. my priority is making sure that we get more people hired. if we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you’re going to see rising incomes again. the reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. i know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep china playing by the rules.

2869,OBAMA,"ok. we need to create jobs here. and both governor romney and i agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. it’s too high. but there’s a difference in terms of how we would do it. i want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to china; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. all those changes in our tax code would make a difference. now, governor romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. one of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don’t have to pay u.s. taxes. but, of course, if you’re a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you’ve got to pay even the reduced rate that governor romney’s talking about. and it’s estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs. the problem is they’ll be in china. or india. or germany. that’s not the way we’re going to create jobs here. the way we’re going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. and we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments i made when i was president. that’s creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. that’s why we’ve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that american workers and american businesses are getting a good deal. now, governor romney talked about china, as i already indicated. in the private sector, governor romney’s company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. that’s not my phrase. that’s what reporters called it. and as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since i’ve been president because we have pushed them hard. and we’ve put unprecedented trade pressure on china. that’s why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. that’s going to help to create jobs here.

2889,MR. KENNEDY,"mr. smith, mr. nixon. in the election of 1860, abraham lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. in the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. i think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the united states, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. we discuss tonight domestic issues, but i would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with mr. khrushchev for survival. mr. khrushchev is in new york, and he maintains the communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the soviet union itself. the chinese communists have always had a large population. but they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. the kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the united states will be the defense of freedom. if we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we’re moving ahead, then i think freedom will be secure around the world. if we fail, then freedom fails. therefore, i think the question before the american people is: are we doing as much as we can do? are we as strong as we should be? are we as strong as we must be if we’re going to maintain our independence, and if we’re going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? i should make it very clear that i do not think we’re doing enough, that i am not satisfied as an american with the progress that we’re making. this is a great country, but i think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but i think it could be a more powerful country. i’m not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. i’m not satisfied when the united states had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we’re able to sustain our defenses; it means we’re able to meet our commitments abroad. i’m not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food – some of it rotting – even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. i saw cases in west virginia, here in the united states, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because i don’t think we’re meeting our obligations toward these americans. i’m not satisfied when the soviet union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. i’m not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. i think we should have an educational system second to none. i’m not satisfied when i see men like jimmy hoffa – in charge of the largest union in the united states – still free. i’m not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the united states to the fullest. here in the united states, which developed the tennessee valley and which built the grand coulee and the other dams in the northwest united states at the present rate of hydropower production – and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society – the soviet union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. these are all the things, i think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. i’m not satisfied until every american enjoys his full constitutional rights. if a negro baby is born – and this is true also of puerto ricans and mexicans in some of our cities – he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. he has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. he has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. he has about uh – four times as much chance that he’ll be out of work in his life as the white baby. i think we can do better. i don’t want the talents of any american to go to waste. i know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. i don’t at all. i want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. and i want the states to meet their responsibilities. but i think there is also a national responsibility. the argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. the people of the united states individually could not have developed the tennessee valley; collectively they could have. a cotton farmer in georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in wisconsin and minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. seventeen million americans, who live over sixty-five on an average social security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they’re not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. i don’t believe in big government, but i believe in effective governmental action. and i think that’s the only way that the united states is going to maintain its freedom. it’s the only way that we’re going to move ahead. i think we can do a better job. i think we’re going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. we cannot turn the job over to anyone else. if the united states fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. and i think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. the reason franklin roosevelt was a good neighbor in latin america was because he was a good neighbor in the united states. because they felt that the american society was moving again. i want us to recapture that image. i want people in latin america and africa and asia to start to look to america; to see how we’re doing things; to wonder what the resident of the united states is doing; and not to look at khrushchev, or look at the chinese communists. that is the obligation upon our generation. in 1933, franklin roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of americans has a rendezvous with destiny. i think our generation of americans has the same rendezvous. the question now is: can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack – attack it has ever known? i think it can be. and i think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. i think it’s time america started moving again.

",0,True,Federal Spending,29,18,surplus
2899,MR. KENNEDY,"well, because i think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh – then i think you would have complete uh – economic chaos. the farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. there are hundreds of thousands of them. they really don’t – they’re not able to control their market very well. they bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. they have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs – a few large companies in many cases – and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. i think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. and if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the united states sooner or later will collapse. the farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the united states. the automobile industry is the number one market for steel. so if the farmers’ economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then i think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. so i think the case for the government intervention is a good one. secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. the dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh – surpluses – nine billion dollars worth. we’ve had a uh – higher tax load from the treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. i think that this farm policy has failed. in my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. and that can only be done through governmental action. i therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance – attempt effective production controls – so that we won’t have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. i think mr. benson’s program has failed. and i must say, after reading the vice president’s speech before the farmers, as he read mine, i don’t believe that it’s very much different from mr. benson’s. i don’t think it provides effective governmental controls. i think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was mr. benson’s theory. i therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.

2909,MR.

KENNEDY,"if i may take the bills, we did pass in the senate a bill uh – to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage. it failed because the house did not pass it and the house failed by eleven votes. and i might say that two-thirds of the republicans in the house voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the democrats sustained it – nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. we were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter – it’s extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. all the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the house or the senate. secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the senate. it failed to came to the floor of the house of representatives. it was killed in the rules committee. and it is a fact in the august session that the four members of the rules committee who were republicans joining with two democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the house. four democrats voted for it. every republican on the rules committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the house of representatives. thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that’s been going on for twenty-five years in social security. we wanted to tie it to social security. we offered an amendment to do so. forty-four democrats voted for it, one republican voted for it. and we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the president of the united states would veto it. in my judgment, a vigorous democratic president supported by a democratic majority in the house and senate can win the support for these programs. but if you send a republican president and a democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the august session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.

2921,MR.

2925,MR. NIXON,"i agree with senator kennedy’s appraisal generally in this respect. the question of communism within the united states has been one that has worried us in the past. it is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. we have to remember that the cold war that mr. khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it’s waged right here in the united states. that’s why we have to continue to be alert. it is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the communists would destroy. we uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. and, in this connection, i think that uh – we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight communism at home not only by our laws to deal with communists uh – the few who do become communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the communists feed upon. and in that connection i again would say that while senator kennedy says we are for the status quo, i do believe that he uh – would agree that i am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. the question again is not one of goals – we’re for those goals – it’s one of means.

2927,MR. NIXON,"not at all. as a matter of fact your question brings out a point that i am very glad to make. too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. now that isn’t the test of whether america moves. the test of whether america moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all – individual enterprise – moves. we have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. now, the reason the eisenhower administration has moved, the reason that we’ve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. and that is growth. that is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.

2931,MR. NIXON,"thank you, mr. smith. senator kennedy. first of all, i think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the soviet union in this whole matter of growth. the soviet union has been moving faster than we have. but the reason for that is obvious. they start from a much lower base. although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. that’s the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. and as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the united states is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. is this any reason for complacency? not at all because these are determined men. they are fanatical men. and we have to get the very most of uh – out uh – out of our economy. i agree with senator kennedy completely on that score. where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. i respectfully submit that senator kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. i believe that when we examine the democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that i have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that i have advocated. there are many of the points that he has made that i would like to comment upon. the one in the field of health is worth mentioning. our health program – the one that senator javits and other republican senators, as well as i supported – is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. it provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. but it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. his program under social security, would require everybody who had social security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. and it would not cover several million people who are not covered by social security at all. here is one place where i think that our program does a better job than his. the other point that i would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost i think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when – during the truman administration when the government was spending more than it took in – we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. we found the people who could least afford it – people on retired incomes uh – people on fixed incomes – we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. it is essential that a man who’s president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. and i stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. but it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.

2933,MR. KENNEDY,"the point was made by mr. nixon that the soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours. i must say that forty-four percent and that soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. i want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. i don’t want to see the day when it’s sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. secondly, the vice president mentioned medical care for the aged. our program was an amendment to the kerr bill. the kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on social security. i think it’s a very clear contrast. in 1935, when the social security act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five republicans voted against it. mr. landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. in august of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one republican in the senate on this occasion. thirdly, i think the question before the american people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all americans. the means are at question. the means are at issue. if you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the united states is increasing in relation to that of the communists; that we’ve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then i agree. i think you should vote for mr. nixon. but if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as franklin roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people – what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. as i said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all republicans and all democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the communists going to be successful? that’s the great issue. and if we meet our responsibilities i think freedom will conquer. if we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then i think that uh – the tide could begin to run against us. and i don’t want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the united states. i want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the united states started to move again. that’s the question before the american people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. i think we’re ready to move. and it is to that great task, if we’re successful, that we will address ourselves.

2990,MR.

3007,MR. MONDALE,"first of all, let me sharply disagree with the president on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in america with the soviet union. we have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the soviets are behind us. and any research or development along the star wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. and the thought that we would share this with the soviet union is, in my opinion, a total non-starter. i would not let the soviet union get their hands on it at all. now, what’s wrong with star wars? there’s nothing wrong with the theory of it. if we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, i suppose it’s a good idea. but the fact of it is we’re so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the director of engineering research at the defense department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the manhattan project. it would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. the second thing is this all assumes that the soviets wouldn’t respond in kind. and they always do. we don’t get behind. they won’t get behind. and that’s been the tragic story of the arms race. we have more at stake in space satellites than they do. if we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons — and the president’s proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn’t have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something — but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that’s very dangerous indeed. one final point. the most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. that’s dead wrong. there wouldn’t be time for a president to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. it might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it’s a missile — and off we go. why don’t we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?

(laughter) i said i’d do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform. and i won. and i had the will of the people in my state behind me. and then i brought folks together to get it done. and that’s what we need, i think, in this election. to me that’s what it’s all about. i’m sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected. but there’s a record, and that’s what i hope people look at. one of my promises is going to be social security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus. now remember, social security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015. people are going to get paid. but if you’re a younger worker, if you’re younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you’re gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits. and you bet we’re gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today. that’s one of my promises. but it’s gonna require people to bring both republicans and democrats together to get it done. that’s what it requires. there was a chance to get this done. it was a bipartisan approach, but it’s been rejected. i’m going to bring them together.

I don’t think it’s fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven’t been hit by it personally. But everybody’s affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything’s more expensive. Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket. So it’s that. But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you’re president of the US.

3243,BILL CLINTON,"Well, I’ve been governor of a small state for 12 years. I’ll tell you how it’s affected me. Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with. I see people in my state, middle class people — their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts. I have seen what’s happened in this last 4 years when — in my state, when people lose their jobs there’s a good chance I’ll know them by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them. And I’ve been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance. What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because we’ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. We’ve gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. We’ve had 4 years where we’ve produced no private sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory. And this decision you’re about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I’m going to go fix it but what are we going to do? I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.

3248,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Well, the Social Security — you’re an expert and I could, I’m sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund. The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it’s projected out to be sound beyond that. So at least we have time to work with it. But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going. Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth. I can’t give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund. All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions. And that is very important. But it’s — the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good. It’s still the most respected credit. So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you’re going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund. And I think that’s the only answer. But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure. One thing I’ve called for that has been stymied, and I’ll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation. It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages. And it’s a big fight. And I don’t want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through. And you can’t just go up and say I’m going to fix it. You’ve got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you. But that’s what the election’s about. I agree with the governor. That’s what the election’s about. And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned. ",1,True,"Economy, Federal Spending, Social Welfare",64,8,"Social Security, Social Security, Social Security, economy, economy, Social Security, deficit"
3262,BILL CLINTON,"I think I remember the question. (Laughter.) Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy. What you have to decide is who’s got the best economic plan. And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record. So I don’t want you to read my lips and I sure don’t want you to read his. I do hope you will read our plans. Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it. There are different ideas — the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton — we have different ideas. I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets. You’ve got to do that; we got to get those costs down. Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program — a lot of you may not know this — it produces a $70 billion surplus a year. Social Security is in surplus $70 billion. Six increases in the payroll tax — that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief. What do we have to do? By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we’re okay. Number 3, on the pension funds, I don’t know as much about it, but I will say this. What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it’s not just enough to have the guarantee. We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right? We had a guarantee — and what happened? You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it. So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.

3266,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Well, we have come to that position. Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don’t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we’ll get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we’ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff that’s happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they’ll think it’s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we’re going to stay engaged, as long as I’m president, working to improve things. You know, it’s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute we’re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It’s the US that’s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We’re doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn’t listen to the freeze — the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember — freeze it, back in the late 70s — freeze, don’t touch it; we’re going to lock it in now or else we’ll have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now we’re working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed — through cooperation, Ross — it worked with cooperation, and you’re for that, I’m sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn’t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he’d have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this. Excuse me, Carole. ",1,True,Oil Industry,62,8,oil
3270,BILL CLINTON,"I’d rather answer her question first and then I’ll be glad to. Because the question you ask is important. The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change. Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing. And it also requires us to maintain some continuity — some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles. And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say — number one — we do have to maintain the world’s strongest defense. We may differ about what the elements of that are. I think that defense needs to be — with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people. I think we’re going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics. Number 2, if you don’t rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won’t be a superpower. We can’t have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country. We have to be the strongest economic power in the world. That’s what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy. And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it’s in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting. We can’t impose it, but we need to nourish it and that’s the kind of thing that I would do as president — follow those three commitments into the future. ",0,True,Economy,25,1,economy
3277,BILL CLINTON,"First of all, let me say that I’ve spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue. Seventy percent of my state’s money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other — they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and I’ve spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it’s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, there’s too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don’t go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, we’d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices — I favor public schools or these new charter schools — we can talk about that if you want. I don’t think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically. ",0,True,Public Education,32,1,"high school graduates, high school graduates"

So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget — not very much. The other stuff — all the other stuff I mentioned — costs much less than that. The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more. And it’s all covered in my budget from — the plans that I’ve laid out — from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget. It’s all covered in the plan. ",0,True,National Defense,47,1,defense budget
3292,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said. My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools. It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II. It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want. And where it’s been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren’t chosen find that they then compete and do better. So I think it’s worth a shot. We’ve got a pilot program. It ought to be tried. School choice — public, private or religious. Not to the schools but to — you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school. Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think — make all schools better. ",1,True,Public Education,32,8,school teachers

We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school. It’s the most successful thing we’ve ever done. Just a fact clarification real quickly. We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country. There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education. We spend more on education ’cause we spend so much more on colleges. But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference. There are great public schools where there’s public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals. I’ll just mention one — the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago. I commend it to anybody.

And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time. I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way. This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy. I mean, women know what’s it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work. They know what it’s like not to have flexible working hours.

One is to raise taxes. One is to reduce spending — controlling that mandatory spending. Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth. I do not want to raise taxes. I differ with the 2 here on that. I’m just not going to do that. I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending. I think we need to invest and save more. I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better. I believe that we need to export more so I’ll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family. We’ve got to strengthen the family. Now, let me pose this question to America. If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis — there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat — my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?

I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly. I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you’ve had on making this a more positive experience. These problems are not easy. They’re not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things. First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things — more jobs and better schools. Our schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that. This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty. I’m proud of that. It happened because I could work with people — Republicans and Democrats. That’s why we’ve had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. You have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn’t work. We’ve had 12 years of trickle down economics. It’s time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. I’m the only person here who’s ever balanced a government budget and I’ve presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. We’ve got to grow the economy by putting people first — real people like you.

3883,MR.

[laughter] i don’t have a plan to tax — or increase taxes. i’m not going to increase taxes. i can understand why you are, mr. mondale, because as a senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. now, i believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it’s that government is overfed. and i think that most of our people — this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. and, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. from 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut. now, the social security tax of ’77 — this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. it had two features. it had several tax increases phased in over a period of time — there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. at the same time every year, it increased the amount of money — virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there — that was subject to that tax. today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for social security. and that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 — they’re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. now, i don’t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn’t work out that way. the system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as i’ve said, and that has not been changed. but if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. but if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.

In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us. I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend. Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion. And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. That old adage they use–we’re going to soak the rich- -we’re going to soak the rich–it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.

There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US. But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan’s former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. We’re going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane. We’re going to have to do some things that are quite costly. And I simply don’t believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded. I don’t think we need 150,000 troops. Let me make one other point. Mr. Bush talked about taxes.

The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who’ve looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy. That’s why I think we shouldn’t do it that quickly.

NIXON,"well mr. drummond, first of all, referring to secretary dulles’ press conference, i think if you read it all – and i know that you have – you will find that secretary dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that quemoy could better be defended. there were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly i don’t think there was any implication in secretary dulles’ statement that quemoy and matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on formosa. now as far as president eisenhower is concerned, i have often heard him discuss this question. as i uh – related a moment ago, the president has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. so first it will be quemoy and matsu, next it may be formosa. what do we do then? my point is this: that once you do this – follow this course of action – of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. and that means war. we went through this tragic experience leading to world war ii. we learned our lesson again in korea, we must not learn it again. that is why i think the senate was right, including a majority of the democrats, a majority of the republicans, when they rejected senator kennedy’s position in 1955. and incidentally, senator johnson was among those who rejected that position – voted with the seventy against the twelve. the senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. and may i say, too, that i would trust that senator kennedy would change his position on this – change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors – the chinese communist and the soviet aggressors – to press the united states, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. the road to war is always paved with good intentions. and in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. but certainly we’re not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.

4558,MR. KENNEDY,"i don’t think it’s possible for mr. nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. in 1955, mr. dulles at a press conference said: “the treaty that we have with the republic of china excludes quemoy and matsu from the treaty area.” that was done with much thought and deliberation. therefore that treaty does not commit the united states to defend anything except formosa and the pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. i completely sustained the treaty. i voted for it. i would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, formosa, and the pescadores island. what we’re now talking about is the vice president’s determination to guarantee quemoy and matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of red china, which are not within the treaty area. i do not suggest that chiang kai-shek – and this administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade chiang kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. uh – he sent a mission – the president – in 1955 of mr. uh – robertson and admiral radford. general twining said they were still doing it in 1959. general ridgway said – who was chief of staff: “to go to war for quemoy and matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. to me that concept is completely repugnant.” so i stand with them. i stand with the secretary of state, mr. herter, who said these islands were indefensible. i believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the chinese communists attack the pescadores and formosa, they know that it will mean a war. i would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun. but i merely say that the treaty is quite precise and i sustain the treaty. mr. nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- republic of china when he’s never really protested the communists seizing cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the united states.

4572,MR.

4574,MR. NIXON,"mr. mcgee, i am planning a speech on that subject next week. uh – also, so that we can get the uh – opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. uh – i will say simply, in advance of it, that i believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh – as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. now, i have a basic disagreement with senator kennedy, though, on this point. he has taken the position, when he first indicated in october of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. i understand in his last speech before the steelworkers union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. i do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. i think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a – be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control – all the things that we do not want. i do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the united states powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. one last point i should make. the record in handling them has been very good during this administration. we have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. and i only want to say that however good the record is, it’s got to be better. because in this critical year – period of the sixties we’ve got to move forward, all americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. we cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we’re in the terrible competition we’re in with the soviets. ",1,True,Economy,25,15,economy
4578,MR. KENNEDY,"yes, i have stated in both uh – debates and state again that i believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the congress. the only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession – and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars – or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in world war ii and uh – during part of the korean war. on the question of the cost of our budget, i have stated that it’s my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. my judgment is that the program the vice president put forward, which is an extension of mr. benson’s program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. we’ve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the agricultural department before that. secondly, i believe that the high interest-rate policy that this administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt – merely funding the debt – which is a burden an the taxpayers. i would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. third, i think it’s possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which i believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. fourthly, i have suggested that the medical care for the aged – and the bill which the congress now has passed and the president signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the treasury – out of treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states – the proposal that i have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under social security; which would be financed under the social security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors’ bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. it is actuarially sound. so in my judgment we would spend more money in this administration on aid to education, we’d spend more money on housing, we’d spend more money and i hope more wisely on defense than this administration has. but i believe that the next administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. mr. nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh – is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where i stand and i just want to have it on the public record.

4580,MR. NIXON,"senator kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that i have been misstating his record and his figures. i will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that i have been correct. now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what i would call, mirror game of “here-it-is-and-here-it-isn’t.” uh – on the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn’t a problem because it’s from social security. but social security is a tax. the people pay it. it comes right out of your paycheck. this doesn’t mean that the people aren’t going to be paying the bill. he also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours. well, all that i can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the – america has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. and i would also point out that senator kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program – a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. now are we going to have that when it isn’t going to help the farmers? i don’t think we should have that kind of a program. then he goes on to say that he’s going to change the interest-rate situation and we’re going to get some more money that way. well, what he is saying there in effect, we’re going to have inflation. we’re going to go right back to what we had under mr. truman when he had political control of the federal reserve board. i don’t believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.

4583,MR. NIXON,"mr. drummond, i am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. i’m not satisfied with it even if there were no communism in the world, but particularly when we’re in the kind of a race we’re in, we have got to see that america grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. because even though we have maintained, as i pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the soviet union; even though the growth in this administration has been twice as much as it was in the truman administration; that isn’t good enough. because america must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health – all these things we want. we’ve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war – uh – for the world in asia, in africa and latin america. it’s going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. now, what do we do about it? and here i believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of america, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. so that is why i advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. in addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. i refer, for example, to distressed areas. we have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. we also have to see that all of the people of the united states – the tremendous talents that our people have – are used adequately. that’s why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it’s for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. and in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: america has not been standing still. let’s get that straight. anybody who says america’s been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn’t been traveling around america. he’s been traveling in some other country. we have been moving. we have been moving much faster than we did in the truman years. but we can and must move faster, and that’s why i stand so strongly for programs that will move america forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the soviet union and win the battle for freedom and peace.

4585,MR. KENNEDY,"well first may i correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. that’s untrue. the fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. the t- man who grows tomatoes – it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. and i believe when the average hour for many farmers’ wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. but anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the vice president is in error. the vice president suggested a number of things. he suggested that we aid distressed areas. the administration has vetoed that bill passed by the congress twice. he suggested we pass an aid to education bill. but the administration and the republican majority in the congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. and the vice president cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers’ salaries in the senate, which prevented that being added. this administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth – which means jobs – of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. and when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we’re going to have to grow more. governor rockefeller says five per cent. the democratic platform and others say five per cent. many say four and a half per cent. the last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent. that’s why we don’t have full employment today.

4587,MR.

4589,MR. NIXON,"senator kennedy’s position and mine completely different on this. i favor the present depletion allowance. i favor it not because i want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because i want to make america rich. why do we have a depletion allowance? because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. if we didn’t have a depletion allowance of certainly, i believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the senator’s. and it’s because of my belief that if america is going to have the growth that he talks about and that i talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. and so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. one other thing. he suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. he also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. i should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you’re not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. but i oppose it. i oppose it for the reasons that i mentioned. i oppose it because i want us to have more oil exploration and not less.

4597,MR. KENNEDY,"well, i think there are many uh – tests, mr. drummond, of prestige. and the significance of prestige, really, is because we’re so identified with the cause of freedom. therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh – who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of communism, they’ll be persuaded to follow our example. there have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. mr. george allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and i quote him, i believe i paraphrase him accurately. he said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. and therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the soviet union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the united states. secondly, the economic growth of the soviet union is greater than ours. mr. dulles has suggested it’s from two to three times as great as ours. this has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. three, a gallup poll taken in february asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. and a majority in every country except greece, felt that it would be the soviet union by l970. four, in the votes at the u.n., particularly the vote dealing with red china last saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two african countries – one, liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, union of south africa, which is not a popular country in africa. every other ca- african country either abstained or voted against us. a – more countries voted against us in asia on this issue than voted with us. on the neutralists’ resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. the candidate who was a candidate for the president of brazil, took a trip to cuba to call on mr. castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the castro supporters uh – within brazil. there are many indications. guinea and ghana, two independent countries within the last three years – guinea in fifty-seven, ghana within the last eighteen months – both now are supporting the soviet foreign policy at the u.n. mr. herter said so himself. laos is moving in that direction. so i would say our prestige is not so high. no longer do we give the image of being on the rise. no longer do we give an image of vitality.

4599,MR. NIXON,"well, i would say first of all that senator’s – kennedy’s statement that he’s just made is not going to help our gallup polls abroad and it isn’t going to help our prestige either. let’s look at the other side of the coin. let’s look at the vote on the congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the soviet union. let’s look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. we find that the soviet union is a very primitive economy. its growth rate is not what counts; it’s whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. we’re well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in america and don’t run her down in order to build her up. we could look also at other items which senator kennedy has named, but i will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what’s right. and getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of quemoy and matsu. i can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the united states among the free nations in asia than for us to take senator kennedy’s advan- advice to go – go against what a majority of the members of the senate, both democrat and republican, did – said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the communists. in other words, if the united states is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. thi- certainly we have been speaking, i know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. let’s remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.

CARTER,"(chuckle) well, in the first place, i’m not criticizing his holiness the pope. i was talking about mr. ford. the uh – fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the ford administration. in the case of the helsinki agreement – it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out. the soviet union is still jamming radio free europe – radio – uh- uh – radio free europe is being jammed. we’ve also seen a very serious uh – problem with the so-called sonnenfeldt document, which apparently mr. ford has just endorsed, which said that there’s an organic linkage between the eastern european countries and the soviet union. and i would like to see mr. ford convince the polish-americans and the czech-americans and the hungarian-americans in this country that those countries don’t live under the domination and supervision of the soviet union behind the iron – uh – curtain. we also have seen mr. ford exclude himself from access to the public. he hasn’t had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. one press conference he had without sound. he’s also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure. the soviet union, for instance, put pressure on mr. ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, aleksandr solzhenitsyn. the arabs have put pressure on mr. ford, and he’s yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the arab countries of american businesses who trade with israel, or who have american jews owning or taking part in the management of american – companies. his own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott. they didn’t volunteer the information. he had to be subpoenaed. and the last thing i’d like to say is this: this grain deal with the soviet union in ’72 was terrible, and mr. ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in japan. that’s not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade. ms. frederic: mr. trewhitt, a question for governor carter.

5067,MR. CARTER,"i would never single out food as a trade embargo item. if i ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. for instance, if the arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil i would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and i would respond instantly and in kind. i would not ship that arab country anything – no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. i wouldn’t single out just food. another thing that i’d like to say is this: in our international trade, as i said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. when this republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. the shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the middle east. under the last democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the middle east were for israel. nowadays – 75 percent were for israel before. now 60 percent go to the arab countries, and this does not include iran. if you include iran, our present shipment of weapons to the middle east, only 20 percent goes to israel. this is a deviation from idealism; it’s a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the middle east, which is israel; it’s a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the arabs on the oil issue; and it’s also a tremendous indication that under the ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. we still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. and it’s an overall sign of weakness. when we are weak at home economically – high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that’s been put on us successfully. it would’ve been inconceivable ten – fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an arab oil embargo. but it was done three years ago and they’re still putting pressure on us from the arab countries to our discredit around the world. these are the weaknesses that i see, and i believe it’s not just a matter of idealism. it’s a matter of being tough. it’s a matter of being strong. it’s a matter of being consistent. our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. as a matter of fact, iran is gonna get eighty f-14s before we even meet our own air force orders for f-l4s. and the shipment of spruance-class destroyers to iran are much more highly sophisticated than the spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own navy. this is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.

(laughter) you know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the great depression. millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. the financial system had frozen up. and because of the resilience and the determination of the american people, we’ve begun to fight our way back. over the last 30 months, we’ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. the auto industry has come roaring back. and housing has begun to rise. but we all know that we’ve still got a lot of work to do. and so the question here tonight is not where we’ve been, but where we’re going. governor romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we’ll be better off. i’ve got a different view. i think we’ve got to invest in education and training. i think it’s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in america, that we change our tax code to make sure that we’re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the united states, that we take some of the money that we’re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild america and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters — to you — which path we should take. are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says america does best when the middle class does best? and i’m looking forward to having that debate.

5141,ROMNEY,"well, sure. i’d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. first of all, i don’t have a $5 trillion tax cut. i don’t have a tax cut of a scale that you’re talking about. my view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. but i’m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. high-income people are doing just fine in this economy. they’ll do fine whether you’re president or i am. the people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income americans. under the president’s policies, middle-income americans have been buried. they’re just being crushed. middle- income americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. this is a — this is a tax in and of itself. i’ll call it the economy tax. it’s been crushing. at the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. electric rates are up. food prices are up. health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. middle-income families are being crushed.

5142,ROMNEY,"and so the question is how to get them going again. and i’ve described it. it’s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. those are the — the cornerstones of my plan. but the president mentioned a couple of other ideas i’ll just note. first, education. i agree: education is key, particularly the future of our economy. but our training programs right now, we’ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. overhead is overwhelming. we’ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. the second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. and i do, both for corporations and for individuals. but in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, i also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. the third area, energy. energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the u.s. is up. but not due to his policies. in spite of his policies. mr. president, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. on government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. if i’m president, i’ll double them, and also get the — the oil from offshore and alaska. and i’ll bring that pipeline in from canada. and, by the way, i like coal. i’m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. people in the coal industry feel like it’s getting crushed by your policies. i want to get america and north america energy independent so we can create those jobs. and finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, i’m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the — the revenues going to the government. my — my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. i want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. but i do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income americans. and i — and to do that, that also means i cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income americans. so any — any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.

5144,OBAMA,"well, i think — let’s talk about taxes, because i think it’s instructive. now, four years ago, when i stood on this stage, i said that i would cut taxes for middle-class families. and that’s exactly what i did. we cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. and the reason is, because i believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. and by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. they are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. they can buy a computer for their kid who’s going off to college, which means they’re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. now, governor romney’s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. and he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. the problem is that he’s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn’t been able to identify them. but i’m going to make an important point here, jim.

5274,ROMNEY,"i sure do. well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. you know, i was in new hampshire. a woman came to me and she said, look, i can’t afford insurance for myself or my son. i met a couple in appleton, wisconsin, and they said, we’re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can’t afford it. and the number of small businesses i’ve gone to that are saying they’re dropping insurance because they can’t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. and — and we’ve got to deal with cost. and, unfortunately, when — when — when you look at obamacare, the congressional budget office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. so it’s adding to cost. and as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. instead, it’s gone up by that amount. so it’s expensive. expensive things hurt families. so that’s one reason i don’t want it. second reason, it cuts $716 billion from medicare to pay for it. i want to put that money back in medicare for our seniors. number three, it puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. i don’t like that idea. fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what’s been the effect of obamacare on your hiring plans? and three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. i just don’t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the — at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the american people. it has killed jobs. and the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. and then let’s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.

5276,OBAMA,"well, four years ago, when i was running for office, i was traveling around and having those same conversations that governor romney talks about. and it wasn’t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn’t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. it wasn’t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. if they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. if they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. and so as a consequence, they’re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don’t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they’ve hit the limit. so we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. and let me tell you exactly what obamacare did. number one, if you’ve got health insurance, it doesn’t mean a government takeover. you keep your own insurance. you keep your own doctor. but it does say insurance companies can’t jerk you around. they can’t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. they have to let you keep your kid on their insurance — your insurance plan until you’re 26 years old. and it also says that you’re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. number two, if you don’t have health insurance, we’re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you’re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. now, the last point i’d make before… ",0,True,"Economy, Health Care, Federal Spending",10,12,"small businesses, businesses, federal deficit, deficit, health care, insurance companies, insurance companies, health insurance, insurance companies, insurance companies, health insurance"
5282,ROMNEY,"we didn’t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they’re going to receive. we didn’t also do something that i think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put — put people in a position where they’re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. right now, the cbo says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year. and likewise, a study by mckinsey and company of american businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. so for those reasons, for the tax, for medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the american people don’t want medicare — don’t want obamacare. it’s why republicans said, do not do this, and the republicans had — had the plan. they put a plan out. they put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. it was swept aside. i think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. and we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties. ",1,True,Economy,25,7,businesses
5283,OBAMA,"governor romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. this was a bipartisan idea. in fact, it was a republican idea. and governor romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in massachusetts could be a model for the nation. and i agree that the democratic legislators in massachusetts might have given some advice to republicans in congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it’s the same plan. it — when governor romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we’ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? because there — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. one is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that’s been the trend line. or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? and there are ways of doing it. so at cleveland clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. and the reason they do is because they do some smart things. they — they say, if a patient’s coming in, let’s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. let’s make sure that we’re providing preventive care so we’re catching the onset of something like diabetes. let’s — let’s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they’ve — they’ve engaged in. now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let’s use the purchasing power of medicare and medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. and the fact of the matter is that, when obamacare is fully implemented, we’re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. and over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up — it’s true — but they’ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. so we’re already beginning to see progress. in the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you’re already getting a rebate. let me make one last point. governor romney says, we should replace it, i’m just going to repeal it, but — but we can replace it with something. but the problem is, he hasn’t described what exactly we’d replace it with, other than saying we’re going to leave it to the states.

5284,OBAMA,"but the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he’s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there’s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who’s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. in fact, it’s estimated that by repealing obamacare, you’re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance… ",0,True,Health Care,15,12,health insurance
5290,ROMNEY,"well, actually it’s — it’s — it’s a lengthy description. but, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. that’s already offered in the private marketplace. you don’t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. but let’s come back to something the president and i agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it’s more affordable for families. and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. (crosstalk) ",1,True,Health Care,15,7,health care
5291,ROMNEY,"in my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. as a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. your example of the cleveland clinic is my case in point, along with several others i could describe. this is the private market. these are small — these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. i used to consult to businesses — excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. i was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the american people. in order to bring the cost of health care down, we don’t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. we instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that’s happening. innermountain healthcare does it superbly well, mayo clinic is doing it superbly well, cleveland clinic, others.

5298,ROMNEY,"which is — which is my experience as a governor is if i come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say, “it’s my way or the highway,” i don’t get a lot done. what i do is the same way that tip o’neill and ronald reagan worked together some years ago. when ronald reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. he said he was going to lower tax rates. he said he was going to broaden the base. you’ve said the same thing, you’re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. those are my principles. i want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. and i’m going to work together with congress to say, ok, what — what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? one way, for instance, would be to have a single number. make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. anybody can have deductions up to that amount. and then that number disappears for high-income people. that’s one way one could do it. one could follow bowles-simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. there are alternatives to accomplish the objective i have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. and with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. you obviously studied up on — on my plan. in fact, i do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. that’s part of my health care plan. and what we did in massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. and i said that at that time. the federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for america to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.

5497,GEORGE W.

5703,MCCAIN,"well, thank you. look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. and let’s keep — never forget the struggle that americans are in today. but when we can — when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, i have disagreed strongly with the bush administration on this issue. i traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, joe lieberman and i. and i introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. that’s the good news, my friends. the bad news is we lost. but we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to — to posing to americans the danger that climate change opposes. now, how — what’s — what’s the best way of fixing it? nuclear power. senator obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. look, i — i was on navy ships that had nuclear power plants. nuclear power is safe, and it’s clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. and — and i know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. the japanese, the british, the french do it. and we can do it, too. senator obama has opposed that. we can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate — alternative energies for — for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs. we can do that, we as americans, because we’re the best innovators, we’re the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the united states of america. ",1,True,"Economy, Climate Change",69,6,"climate change, economy"
5706,OBAMA,"and it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it’s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the united states. it can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. and we can do it, but we’re going to have to make an investment. the same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we’ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. and that’s why we’ve got to make some investments and i’ve called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. contrary to what senator mccain keeps on saying, i favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. but this is another example where i think it is important to look at the record. senator mccain and i actually agree on something. he said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in washington haven’t done anything. what senator mccain doesn’t mention is he’s been there 26 of them. and during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. so it’s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it’s important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. one last point i want to make on energy. senator mccain talks a lot about drilling, and that’s important, but we have three percent of the world’s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. so what that means is that we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem. and we’re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. we’re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the united states government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like china that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. we’ve got to make sure that we’re giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.

5713,MCCAIN,"i think pure research and development investment on the part of the united states government is certainly appropriate. i think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector. by the way, my friends, i know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. it was an energy bill on the floor of the senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by bush and cheney. you know who voted for it? you might never know. that one. you know who voted against it? me. i have fought time after time against these pork barrel — these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes. i vote against them, my friends. i vote against them. but the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. we can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there’s a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. that’s fundamental economics. we’ve got to drill offshore, my friends, and we’ve got to do it now, and we can do it. and as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. senator obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. and i’ll stop, tom, and you didn’t even wave. thanks.

5715,OBAMA,"well, you know, as i travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that i get, is the issue of health care. it is breaking family budgets. i can’t tell you how many people i meet who don’t have health insurance. if you’ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. and your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. if you’re a small business, it’s a crushing burden. so one of the things that i have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. so here’s what i would do. if you’ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. you can keep your choice of doctor. we’re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. and we’re going to do it by investing in prevention. we’re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. that will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. if you don’t have health insurance, you’re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that senator mccain and i enjoy as federal employees. because there’s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. and nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. now, senator mccain has a different kind of approach. he says that he’s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. what he doesn’t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. so what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. he would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you’re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. and that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. in fact, just today business organizations like the united states chamber of commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. that, i don’t think, is the kind of change that we need. we’ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. and that’s something that i’m committed to doing as president.

5717,MCCAIN,"well, thank you for the question. you really identified one of the really major challenges that america faces. co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in america. and we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. let’s put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. let’s have community health centers. let’s have walk-in clinics. let’s do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. but what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and senator obama. as you notice, he starts talking about government. he starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he’ll impose mandates. if you’re a small business person and you don’t insure your employees, senator obama will fine you. will fine you. that’s remarkable. if you’re a parent and you’re struggling to get health insurance for your children, senator obama will fine you. i want to give every american a $5,000 refundable tax credit. they can take it anywhere, across state lines. why not? don’t we go across state lines when we purchase other things in america? of course it’s ok to go across state lines because in arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in tennessee. and if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what’s left over and you add $5,000 that you’re going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the american people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get — all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated cadillac kinds of policies. you know, like hair transplants, i might need one of those myself. but the point is that we have got to give people choice in america and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. every parent i know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could. obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. of course they all want to do that. we’ve got to give them the wherewithal to do it. we can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.

5722,OBAMA,"well, i think it should be a right for every american. in a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can’t pay their medical bills — for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they’re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don’t have to pay her treatment, there’s something fundamentally wrong about that. so let me — let me just talk about this fundamental difference. and, tom, i know that we’re under time constraints, but senator mccain through a lot of stuff out there. number one, let me just repeat, if you’ve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. all i’m going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. you’ll still have choice of doctor. there’s no mandate involved. small businesses are not going to have a mandate. what we’re going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. now, it’s true that i say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don’t want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. and when senator mccain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn’t mention is he voted against the expansion of the children’s health insurance program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn’t have previously health insurance have it now. now, the final point i’ll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates — it is absolutely true that i think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don’t give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you’re paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you’re not getting it. and the reason that it’s a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? they will find a state — maybe arizona, maybe another state — where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. that’s how in banking it works. everybody goes to delaware, because they’ve got very — pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. and in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you’re not going to have available to you. that is a fundamental difference that i have with senator mccain. he believes in deregulation in every circumstance. that’s what we’ve been going through for the last eight years. it hasn’t worked, and we need fundamental change.

NIXON,"to combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer – the so-called depressed areas. now in the last congress – the special session of the congress – there was a bill: one by the president, one by senator kennedy and members of his party. now the bill that the president had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it – areas like scranton and wilkes-barre and the areas of west virginia – than the ones that senator kennedy was supporting. on the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. so point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next congress. i have made recommendations on that and i have discussed them previously and i will spell them out further in the campaign. second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. in analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education. it also exists among minority groups. if we’re going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas. that’s why i have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period – and understand, i do not believe we’re going into a recession. i believe this economy is sound and that we’re going to move up. but second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and i mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs – the private sector of the economy. this means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs. i favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you’ve passed through the recessionary period. so we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come. but i do not expect it to come.

5817,MR. KENNEDY,"well mr. nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. i’m very familiar with it. it came out of the committee of which i was the chairman – the labor subcommittee – in fifty-five. i was the floor manager. we passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the administration suggested, on two occasions, and the president vetoed it both times. we passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the senate and it died in the rules committee of the house of representatives. let me make it very clear that the bill that mr. nixon talked about did not mention wilkes-barre or scranton; it did not mention west virginia. our bill was far more effective. the bill introduced and erd- sponsored by senator douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas. secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens. i cannot still understand why this administration and mr. nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under social security to give them some security. third, i believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we’re able to get the people back to work. five cents a day – that’s what the food package averages per person. fourthly, i believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and i think helped bring the slow-down of 1960. if we move into a recession in sixty-one, then i would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed. one is by ex- the programs such as aid to education. the other would be to make a judgment on what’s the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.

5865,MR. CARTER,"again it’s important to put the situation in perspective. in 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of opec oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. we had an even worse oil shock in 1979. in 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the second world war. the recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the second world war. in addition, we’ve brought down inflation. earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the opec price increase. it averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. in the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. the most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% – still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs – nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years – that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. i notice that governor reagan recently mentioned the reagan-kemp-roth proposal. which his own running mate, george bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. and business week, which is not a democratic publication, said that this reagan-kemp-roth proposal – and i quote them, i think – was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. so our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for american workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. so to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.

5871,MR. REAGAN,"mr. ellis, i think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it’s uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it’s dangerous to say this to the people. when mr. carter became president, inflation was 4.8%, as you said. it had been cut in two by president gerald ford. it is now running at 12.7%. president carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. but that can’t hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in america today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. mr. carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. and yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in january, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%. since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, opec, he has blamed the federal reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the american people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. we don’t have inflation because the people are living too well. we have inflation because the government is living too well. and the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because government revenues have not kept pace with government spending. i see my time is running out here. i’ll have to get this out very fast. yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the government is spending more than it takes in. and my economic plan calls for that. the president’s economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. but we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.

5953,MR.

6016,DUKAKIS,"well, andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea. that’s an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent. i don’t rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the congress, i know with the pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad. but there are limits to what we can spend. there are limits to this nation’s ability to finance these weapons systems. and one of the things that the vice president either ignores or won’t address is the fact that you can’t divorce our military security from our economic security. how can we build a strong america militarily that’s teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? and if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the vice president is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. so military security and economic security go hand in hand. and we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. we’re going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported. and we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they’ll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions. and we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. and all of these things are going to have to be addressed. that’s why i say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next president has to do the same. i want the men and women of our armed forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. but we cannot continue to live on a credit card. we cannot continue to tell the american people that we’re going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good america. and that’s the kind of america i want to build.

6084,DUKAKIS,"andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means? now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive social security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income. and yet mr. bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985. medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we’ve had under this administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under medicare. yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it’s going to cost, and that’s going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens. it had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support. but i suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country. so i’m not going to begin, and i’m not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we’re spending billions on something like star wars, when we’re spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the vice president wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut social security, to cut medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance. i talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and i’m proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill and the ruby samsons and dan lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.

6096,DUKAKIS,"i just have to correct the record. that simply isn’t true. now, we’re not a parliamentary body, the national governors association. we vote on resolutions. if you don’t get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn’t pass. but everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of colas did so, we did so emphatically. and i never made that statement; never would. the point is that as we look at this nation’s future, and we have two very different visions of this future. i want to move ahead. the vice president talks about a thousand points of light. i’m interested in 240 million points of light. i’m interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the american dream, all of them in every part of this country. but as we look at the decisions that the next president of the united states is going to have to make, i just don’t believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can’t make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. the vice president did call social security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program. it isn’t. it’s a contract between generations. it’s something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement. it’s a very sacred contract, and i believe in it. so that’s not where we ought to go. there are plenty of places to cut. there’s lots we can do in the pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the american taxpayer. there are we certainly ought to be able to ",0,True,Social Welfare,38,0,social security
6114,DUKAKIS,"i think we ought to be looking at modernization, i think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent. but we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces. and every defense expert i know, including people in the pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the congress has now approved and the president has signed, there’s no way that you can do all of these things and do them well. that’s why tough choices will be required, choices i am prepared to make, mr. bush is not prepared to make. but, andrea, i think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions. i would challenge mr. gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the middle east, in central america. let’s get him working on syria, their client state, and see if we can’t get them to join israel and other arab nations, if at all possible, and arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region. and i think that’s one reason why we need fresh leadership in the white house that can make progress now in bringing peace to the middle east. let’s go to work and end this fiasco in central america, a failed policy which has actually increased cuban and soviet influence. the democratic leaders of central and latin america want to work with us. i’ve met with them, i know them, i’ve spent time in south america-speak the language, so does senator bentsen. we want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us. but not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in central america. and we’ve got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries. those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that i want to pursue mr. bush and i have major differences on these issues and i hope very much to be president and pursue them.
