5,GEORGE W. BUSH,"well, i think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn’t matter who you are or how you’re raised or where you’re from, that you can succeed. i don’t think they’ll look at us with envy. it really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. if we’re an arrogant nation, they’ll resent us. if we’re a humble nation, but strong, they’ll welcome us. and it’s — our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that’s why we have to be humble. and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. so i don’t think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. we’re a freedom-loving nation and if we’re an arrogant nation they’ll view us that way, but if we’re a humble nation they’ll respect us. ",1,False
9,GEORGE W. BUSH,"yes, it does. take, for example, third world debt. i think we ought to be forgiving third world debt under certain conditions. i think, for example, if we’re convinced that a third world country that’s got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn’t go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, i think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes. we do have an obligation, but we can’t be all things to all people. we can help build coalitions but we can’t put our troops all around the world. we can lend money but we have to do it wisely. we shouldn’t be lending money to corrupt officials. so we got to be guarded in our generosity. ",1,False
11,GORE,"the first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. we need to call upon syria to release the three israeli soldiers who have been captured. we need to insist that arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. i think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward saddam hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he’s not only dealing with israel, he is dealing — he’s dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he’s talking about there. the use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. it’s a very tense situation there. but in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. it’s too much to hope that this is going to continue, but i do hope that it will continue. our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. and we just have to take it day-to-day right now. but one thing i would say where diplomacy is concerned, israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. our bonds with israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. they are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. and our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd. ",0,False
13,GEORGE W. BUSH,"well, i think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and i appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. like the vice president, i call on chairman arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. i think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the middle east. i want everybody to know should i be the president israel’s going to be our friend. i’m going to stand by israel. secondly, that i think it’s important to reach out to moderate arab nations, like jordan and egypt, saudi arabia and kuwait. it’s important to be friends with people when you don’t need each other so that when you do there’s a strong bond of friendship. and that’s going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in israel, but with saddam hussein. the coalition against saddam has fallen apart or it’s unraveling, let’s put it that way. the sanctions are being violated. we don’t know whether he’s developing weapons of mass destruction. he better not be or there’s going to be a consequence should i be the president. but it’s important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. one of the reasons why i think it’s important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the middle east if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the saddam husseinâ€™s of the world or the iranians, don’t dare threaten our friends. it’s also important to keep strong ties in the middle east, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we’re now in. after all, a lot of the energy is produced from the middle east, and so i appreciate what the administration is doing. i hope to get a sense of should i be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the middle east. ",1,False
15,GORE,"well, we stand with israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. and one of the reasons that’s important is that israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us. and if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown — we will have thrown away a strategic asset that’s important not only to us but also to israel. ",0,False
17,GEORGE W. BUSH,"i do. i do think this, though. when it comes to timetables it can’t be the united states timetable as to how discussions take place. it’s got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the palestinians and israelis. secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that’s good for both sides. and therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. this current administration’s worked hard to keep the parties at the table. i will try to do the same thing. but it won’t be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the middle east.

22,GEORGE W.

24,GEORGE W. BUSH,i do. ,1,False
25,GORE,"well, when i got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after — i was one of the few members of my political party to support former president bush in the persian gulf war resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed saddam hussein from power. i know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. but the fact is that that’s the situation that was left when i got there. and we have maintained the sanctions. now i want to go further. i want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow saddam hussein, and i know there are allegations that they’re too weak to do it, but that’s what they said about the forces that were opposing milosevic in serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former soviet union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. i know the governor’s not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, i’m told, except for three where they notified, and they’re trying to break out of the box, there’s no question about it. i don’t think they should be allowed to.

29,GEORGE W. BUSH,"i think it’s a triumph. i thought the president made the right decision in joining nato and bombing serbia. i supported them when they did so. i called upon the congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn’t necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation’s strategy, and so i think it’s good public policy, i think it worked, and i’m pleased i took — made the decision i made. i’m pleased the president made the decision he made. because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there’s a lot of work left to be done, however. ",1,False
31,GEORGE W. BUSH,"yes, i think it is. absolutely. i don’t think he would have fallen had we not used the force. and i know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment. i supported the president. i thought he made the right decision to do so. i didn’t think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. the administration deserves credit for having made it work. it is important for nato to have it work. it’s important for nato to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in europe. and one of the reasons i felt so strongly that the united states needed to participate was because of our relations with nato, and nato is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. now, there’s more work to do. remains to be seen, however, whether or not there’s going to be a political settlement in kosovo, and i certainly hope there is one. iâ€™m on record as saying at some point in time i hope our european friends become the peacekeepers in bosnia and in the balkans. i hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war. ",1,False
32,GORE,"well, i’ve been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. when i was in the senate before i became vice president i was pushing for stronger action against milosevic. he caused the death of so many people. he was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. and unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in serbian politics. already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he’s still going to try to be actively involved. he is an indicted war criminal. he should be held accountable. now, i did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe i have heard, maybe i have heard the previous statements wrong, governor. in some of the discussions we’ve had about when it’s appropriate for the u.s. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you’ve laid down have given me the impression that if it’s something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn’t be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the u.s. ought to get involved with troops. now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. but by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental american strategic interest because i think it’s based on our values. now, have i got that wrong? ",0,False
33,GEORGE W. BUSH,"trying to figure out who the questioner was. if i think it’s in our nation’s strategic interest i’ll commit troops. i thought it was in our strategic interests to keep milosevic in check because of our relations in nato, and that’s why i took the position i took. i think it’s important for nato to be strong and confident. i felt like unchecked milosevic would harm nato, and so it depends on the situation, mr. vice president.

63,GEORGE W. BUSH,"i think the administration did the right thing in that case. i do. it was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our tv screens, but it’s a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in rwanda. and that’s a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in africa come together and help deal with the situation. the administration, seems like we’re having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training nigerian troops for situations just such as this in rwanda, and so i thought they made the right decision not to send u.s. troops into rwanda. ",1,False
67,GEORGE W. BUSH,"well, i understand, and africa is important. and we’ve got to do a lot of work in africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some — vice president mentioned nigeria is a fledgling democracy. we have to work with nigeria. itâ€™s an important continent. but there’s got to be priorities, and middle east is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is europe and the far east, our own hemisphere. and those are my four top priorities should i be the president, not to say we won’t be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. i thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was east timor when we provided logistical support to the australians, support that only we can provide. i thought that was a good model. but we can’t be all things to all people in the world, jim. and i think that’s where maybe the vice president and i begin to have some differences. i’m worried about overcommitting our military around the world. i want to be judicious in its use. you mentioned haiti. i wouldn’t have sent troops to haiti. i didn’t think it was a mission worthwhile. it was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. it cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and i’m not so sure democracy is any better off in haiti than it was before. ",1,False
69,GORE,"i don’t think we agree on that. i would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of american troops overseas. i think we have to be very reticent about that. but look, jim, the world is changing so rapidly. the way i see it, the world is getting much closer together. like it or not, we are now — the united states is now the natural leader of the world. all these other countries are looking to us. now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn’t be, doesn’t mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. now, both of us are kind of, i guess, stating the other’s position in a maximalist extreme way, but i think there is a difference here. this idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, world war ii. during the years between world war i and world war ii, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the united states. the lesson was that in the aftermath of world war i, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became world war ii. and acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in world war ii, we laid down the marshall plan, president truman did. we got intimately involved in building nato and other structures there. we still have lots of troops in europe. and what did we do in the late ’40’s and ’50’s and ’60’s? we were nation building. and it was economic. but it was also military. and the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. we had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back. ",0,False
71,GEORGE W. BUSH,"first let me just say one comment about what the vice president said. i think one of the lessons in between world war i and world war ii is we let our military atrophy. and we can’t do that. we’ve got to rebuild our military. but one of the problems we have in the military is we’re in a lot of places around the world. and i mentioned one, and that’s the balkans. i would very much like to get our troops out of there. i recognize we can’t do it now, nor do i advocate an immediate withdrawal. that would be an abrogation of our agreement with nato. no one is suggesting that. but i think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our european friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. and there is an example. haiti is another example. now there are some places where i think — you know, i’ve supported the administration in columbia. i think it’s important for us to be training columbians in that part of the world. the hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful columbia. but — ",1,False
73,GEORGE W. BUSH,"i don’t think so. i think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. maybe i’m missing something here. i mean, we’re going to have kind of a nation building core from america? absolutely not. our military is meant to fight and win war. that’s what it’s meant to do. and when it gets overextended, morale drops. i strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. and i strongly believe we need to keep a presence in nato, but i’m going to be judicious as to how to use the military. it needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious. ",1,False
74,GORE,"i don’t disagree with that. i certainly don’t disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. that’s what we did in haiti. there are no more than a handful of american military personnel in haiti now. and haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. that’s really about all we can do. but if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then i think that we did the right thing there. and as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. and, you know, we can’t be — we can’t allow ourselves to get overextended. i certainly agree with that. and that’s why i’ve supported building up our capacity. i’ve devoted in the budget i’ve proposed, as i said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. i think that it’s in better shape now than he generally does. we’ve had some disagreements about that. he said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that’s not what the joint chiefs say. but there’s no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. and we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.

78,GEORGE W. BUSH,"that’s a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. i believe we ought to have foreign aid, but i don’t think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. i think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. i think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there’s some pretty egregious examples recently. one being russia, where we had imf loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn’t help the nation. i think the imf has got a role in the world, but i don’t want to see the imf out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we’ll bail you out. it needs to be available for emergency situations. i thought the president did the right thing with mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in mexico. but i don’t think the imf ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. so i’ll look at every place where we’re investing money. i just want to make sure the return is good.

",1,False
234,MCCAIN,"well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? that paid their mortgage payments? it doesn’t help that person in their home if the next door neighbor’s house is abandoned. and so we’ve got to reverse this. we ought to put the homeowners first. and i am disappointed that secretary paulson and others have not made that their first priority.

253,OBAMA,"well, first of all, i think it’s important for the american public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it’s structured properly, and, as president, i will make sure it’s structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that’s important to understand. but there is no doubt that we’ve been living beyond our means and we’re going to have to make some adjustments. now, what i’ve done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. i haven’t made a promise about… ",0,False
255,OBAMA,"absolutely. so let me get to that. what i want to emphasize, though, is that i have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. every dollar that i’ve proposed, i’ve proposed an additional cut so that it matches. ",0,False
258,MCCAIN,"well, thank you, bob. i just want to get back to this home ownership. during the depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation. and they went out and bought up these mortgages. and people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money. and, by the way, this was a proposal made by senator clinton not too long ago. so, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.

288,MCCAIN,"well, this has been a tough campaign. it’s been a very tough campaign. and i know from my experience in many campaigns that, if senator obama had asked — responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the american people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now. when senator obama was first asked, he said, “any place, any time,” the way barry goldwater and jack kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at dallas. so i think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. and the fact is, it’s gotten pretty tough. and i regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. but the fact is that it has taken many turns which i think are unacceptable. one of them happened just the other day, when a man i admire and respect — i’ve written about him — congressman john lewis, an american hero, made allegations that sarah palin and i were somehow associated with the worst chapter in american history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, george wallace. that, to me, was so hurtful. and, senator obama, you didn’t repudiate those remarks. every time there’s been an out-of-bounds remark made by a republican, no matter where they are, i have repudiated them. i hope that senator obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by congressman john lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate. so i want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. this is a tough campaign. and it’s a matter of fact that senator obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. and i can prove it. and, senator obama, when he said — and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if i did — that was back when he was a long-shot candidate — you didn’t keep your word. and when you looked into the camera in a debate with senator clinton and said, “i will sit down and negotiate with john mccain about public financing before i make a decision,” you didn’t tell the american people the truth because you didn’t. and that’s — that’s — that’s an unfortunate part. now we have the highest spending by senator obama’s campaign than any time since watergate.

290,OBAMA,"well, look, you know, i think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. i think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the american people — bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the american people think that senator mccain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine. and 100 percent, john, of your ads — 100 percent of them have been negative.

318,MCCAIN,"well, bob, you asked me a direct question. ",1,False
320,MCCAIN,"yes, real quick. mr. ayers, i don’t care about an old washed-up terrorist. but as senator clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship. we need to know the full extent of senator obama’s relationship with acorn, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. the same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for “lighting and site selection.” so all of these things need to be examined, of course. ",1,False
322,OBAMA,"bob, i think it’s going to be important to just — i’ll respond to these two particular allegations that senator mccain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention. in fact, mr. ayers has become the centerpiece of senator mccain’s campaign over the last two or three weeks. this has been their primary focus. so let’s get the record straight. bill ayers is a professor of education in chicago. forty years ago, when i was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. i have roundly condemned those acts. ten years ago he served and i served on a school reform board that was funded by one of ronald reagan’s former ambassadors and close friends, mr. annenberg. other members on that board were the presidents of the university of illinois, the president of northwestern university, who happens to be a republican, the president of the chicago tribune, a republican- leaning newspaper. mr. ayers is not involved in my campaign. he has never been involved in this campaign. and he will not advise me in the white house. so that’s mr. ayers. now, with respect to acorn, acorn is a community organization. apparently what they’ve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn’t really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. it had nothing to do with us. we were not involved. the only involvement i’ve had with acorn was i represented them alongside the u.s. justice department in making illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at dmvs. now, the reason i think that it’s important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that senator mccain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. let me tell you who i associate with. on economic policy, i associate with warren buffett and former fed chairman paul volcker. if i’m interested in figuring out my foreign policy, i associate myself with my running mate, joe biden or with dick lugar, the republican ranking member on the senate foreign relations committee, or general jim jones, the former supreme allied commander of nato. those are the people, democrats and republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the white house. and i think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, senator mccain, says more about your campaign than it says about me. ",0,False
323,MCCAIN,"well, again, while you were on the board of the woods foundation, you and mr. ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to acorn. so — and you launched your political campaign in mr. ayers’ living room. ",1,False

",1,False
371,MCCAIN,i would consider anyone in their qualifications. i do not believe that someone who has supported roe v. wade that would be part of those qualifications. but i certainly would not impose any litmus test. ,1,False
379,OBAMA,we should try to reduce these circumstances. ,0,False
381,MCCAIN,just again… ,1,False
388,MCCAIN,"we need to encourage programs such as teach for america and troops to teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which — or have the certification that some are required in some states. look, we must improve education in this country. as far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. we need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. we need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. and we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation. ",1,False
392,MCCAIN,"well, sure. i’m sure you’re aware, senator obama, of the program in the washington, d.c., school system where vouchers are provided and there’s a certain number, i think it’s a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that. because they wanted to have the same choice that you and i and cindy and your wife have had. and that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children. and we all know the state of the washington, d.c., school system. that was vouchers. that was vouchers, senator obama. and i’m frankly surprised you didn’t pay more attention to that example. now as far as the no child left behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. it had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in america from a nationwide perspective. and we need to fix a lot of the problems. we need to sit down and reauthorize it. but, again, spending more money isn’t always the answer. i think the head start program is a great program. a lot of people, including me, said, look, it’s not doing what it should do. by the third grade many times children who were in the head start program aren’t any better off than the others. let’s reform it. let’s reform it and fund it. that was, of course, out-of-bounds by the democrats. we need to reform these programs. we need to have transparency. we need to have rewards. it’s a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding. and i just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children — precious children who have autism. sarah palin knows about that better than most. and we’ll find and we’ll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. and we’ll care for these young children. and all americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so. ",1,False
393,MCCAIN,"but to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the united states of america also means that it cries out for reform, as well. and i will support those reforms, and i will fund the ones that are reformed. but i’m not going to continue to throw money at a problem. and i’ve got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. and it’s been proven. ",1,False
394,OBAMA,"i’ll just make a quick comment about vouchers in d.c. senator mccain’s absolutely right: the d.c. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. and we’ve got a wonderful new superintendent there who’s working very hard with the young mayor there to try… ",0,False

398,OBAMA,"but the — but here’s the thing, is that, even if senator mccain were to say that vouchers were the way to go — i disagree with him on this, because the data doesn’t show that it actually solves the problem — the centerpiece of senator mccain’s education policy is to increase the voucher program in d.c. by 2,000 slots. that leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from senator mccain. so if we are going to be serious about this issue, we’ve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. and that’s what i intend to do as president.

455,DOLE,"again, well it’s, you are very selective, mr. president. you don’t want to politicize drugs, but it’s already politicized medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get pell grants and things like this. i mean, you say we’ve done all these bad things, which isn’t the case. but it seems to me the record is clear. the record is pretty clear in arkansas, when you were governor. drug use doubled. you resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. but here you cut the drug czar’s office 83 percent. you cut interdiction substantially. i mean that’s what, i want to stop it from coming across the border. and in my administration, we’re going to train the national guard to stop it from coming across the border. this is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. and we have a responsibility. you had a surgeon — or before general mccaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. is that the kind of leadership we need? and i won’t comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs. but it seems to me the kids ought to — if they’ve started, they ought to stop and just don’t do it. ",1,False
466,DOLE,"well, i have a different view. again, iâ€™ve supported the president on bosnia, and i think we were told the troops would be out in a year. now i understand it’s been extended ’til some time next year. but, let’s start with somalia, where they dragged americans through the streets, and where 18 americans were killed one day, because they didn’t have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. they didn’t have the weapons, they didn’t have the tanks. they asked for the tanks. they didn’t get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. it’s called mission creep. we turn it over to the united nations. the president didn’t have much to do about it. you look at haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. you got to send down some more people, because the president’s found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. so we need more protection from america. bosnia, northern ireland. there’s no ceasefire in bosnia. i think there are still lot of problems in bosnia. we agreed to train and arm the muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. we haven’t done that. we’re way behind, which means americans can’t come home. americans shouldn’t have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under article 57 of the united nations charter. ",1,False
473,DOLE,"well i failed to mention north korea and cuba, a while ago. you look at north korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs. we’ve sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, south korea. they lost about a million people in the war, the korean war, the forgotten war. we lost 53,000 americans. we shouldn’t be doing any favors for north korea. it’s a closed society. we don’t have any inspection. we don’t know whether it’s going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives. someone called them something else. incentives. we don’t know what’s going to happen. here we have cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the president postponed it for six months. and it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you’ve got to send a signal, mr. president. the sooner the better off we’ll be, if you put tougher sanctions on castro, not try to make it easier for him. ",1,False
476,DOLE,"that’s the point i made. we have to be firm and strong. and i hope that will happen. it will happen starting next january and maybe it can happen the balance of this year. we have not been firm and strong. you look at the poor people who still live in cuba. it’s a haven for drug smugglers and we don’t have a firm policy when it comes to fidel castro. in my view, the policy has failed. so congress passes the law, the president signs it, like he does a lot of things. but he, like welfare reform, i’m going to sign it but i’m going to try to change it next year. a lot of these election-year conversions, the president talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996. and i think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment. when he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system. when he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year. this is a serious business. it’s about your family; it’s about your business, and in this case it’s about a firmer policy with cuba.

",1,False
496,DOLE,"well, i was disappointed. the president has not called for an unconditional end to the violence. it seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to america. the killing and tragedies had taken place. and it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it. it shouldn’t be politicized in any way by the president or by his opponent. and i don’t intend to politicize it. i hope they talked and i hope they’ve reached some result and that the killing will end. ",1,False
505,DOLE,"yes. i didn’t favor it when it was in, started. i voted against it. it was a tribute after president carter’s election to the national education association who send a lot of delegates to the democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, democrat democrats, and the president, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. so what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. now, some say, oh, you’re a republican, you can’t be reaching out to these people. i’ve reached out to people all my life. i’ve worked on the food stamp program, proudly. and the wic program, and the school lunch program with senators like george mcgovern, hubert humphrey and others, to name a few of my democratic friends. i’m not some extremist out here. i care about people. i have my own little foundation that’s raised about $10 million for the disabled. i don’t advertise it. just did, haven’t before. and i try to do a lot of things that i think might be helpful to people. so it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the department of education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little landale shakespeare out in cleveland, ohio, and tell your mother and father, you’re going to get to go to school because we’re going to match what the state puts up, and you’re going to go to the school of your choice. i don’t fault the president or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. i applaud them for it, i don’t criticize them. but why shouldn’t everybody have that choice. why shouldn’t low income americans and low middle income americans. i’m excited about it. it’s going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.

510,DOLE,"well, the americorps program, i must say, if that’s one of your successes, i wouldn’t speak about it too loudly. it costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer. we’ve got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn’t gone down. and you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. i like young people. i like teachers. i’m a product of a public school. you attended a private school for some time in your life. i like teachers. you’re not for school choice, you can’t be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. when you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don’t know what happened to the other .5 percent, we’re looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to democrats. and this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can’t do. you’re for school uniforms and curfews and you’re opposed to truancy. now that’s not reform, mr. president. why can’t landale shakespeare in cleveland or pilar gonzales in milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school. some schools aren’t safe. some schools aren’t even safe. your choice is nothing. let’s give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in america. if we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let’s start with education.

513,DOLE,"i had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the white house and other agencies who’ve never been had any experience, who came to washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn’t be in the administration. and their idea was that they knew what was best for the american people. now, i feel very strongly about a lot of things. i feel strongly about education. i want to help young people have an education, just as i had an education after world war ii with the gi bill of rights. we’ve had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education. now the reason they don’t have, the reason the president can’t support this is pretty obvious. it’s not taking anything away from schools, it’s new money. it’s not being taken away from anybody else, except we’ll downsize the department of education. but this is a very liberal administration. this is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. this administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. this is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. this is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that’s what i had in mind. i want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand america. there won’t be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet. there will be people with experience and people who understand america and people who’ve made it and know the hard knocks in life.

515,DOLE,"well, i think it’s pretty liberal, i’ll put that label on it. you take a look at all the programs you’ve advocated, mr. president. thank goodness we had a republican congress there. the first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we’ve got a little pork we want to scatter around america, $16 billion. and even some in your own party couldn’t buy that. i remember talking by the telephone. i’m not even certain you were too excited about that. i won’t, i never repeat what i’ve talked to the president about. in any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion. and then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the congress changed, and i think we’ve done a good job.

518,DOLE,"well, the president can define himself in any way he wants, but i think we have to look at the record. go back to the time he was, what, texas director for george mcgovern. george mcgovern is a friend of mine, so i don’t mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal. i’ve just finished reading a book, i think it’s called — what is it called, what is it, the demise of the democratic party by ronald cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration. whether it’s organized labor or whether it’s the hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it’s the labor unions or whatever. and so i think you take a look at it. the bottom line is this: i think the american people, thought he’d recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what’s going to happen to them. they’ve all got a lot of anxieties out there. did anybody complain when you raised taxes? did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? that’s why we want an economic package. we want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies. that’s what our message is to the people watching. not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better america as we go into the next century.

644,HILLARY CLINTON,"… get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, i’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma… ",0,False
648,TRUMP,"well, i just want—just one thing. first of all, hillary, everything’s broken about it. everything. number two, bernie sanders said that hillary clinton has very bad judgment. this is a perfect example of it, trying to save obamacare, which is a disaster. ",1,False
650,TRUMP,by the way… ,1,False
652,TRUMP,we’re going to be able to. you’re going to have plans… ,1,False
654,TRUMP,"well, i’ll tell you what it means. you’re going to have plans that are so good, because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. once we break out—once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come… ",1,False
656,TRUMP,"president obama—anderson, excuse me. president obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. you know that, because jonathan gruber, the architect of obamacare, was said—he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. president obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. the whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn’t work. but when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we’ll also be able to help people that can’t get—don’t have money because we are going to have people protected. and republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. we’re going to block grant into the states. we’re going to block grant into medicaid into the states… ",1,False
658,TRUMP,… so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves. ,1,False
663,TRUMP,"well, you’re right about islamophobia, and that’s a shame. but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that—because there is a problem. i mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on. when they see hatred going on, they have to report it. as an example, in san bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. horribly wounded. they’ll never be the same. muslims have to report the problems when they see them. and, you know, there’s always a reason for everything. if they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center. go outside. look at paris. look at that horrible—these are radical islamic terrorists. and she won’t even mention the word and nor will president obama. he won’t use the term “radical islamic terrorism.” now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. she won’t say the name and president obama won’t say the name. but the name is there. it’s radical islamic terror. and before you solve it, you have to say the name. ",1,False
665,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, thank you for asking your question. and i’ve heard this question from a lot of muslim-americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about muslims. and even someone like captain khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army, has been subject to attack by donald. i want to say just a couple of things. first, we’ve had muslims in america since george washington. and we’ve had many successful muslims. we just lost a particularly well-known one with muhammad ali. my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place, if you’re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. that’s what america is. that’s what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren. it’s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims. we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. i’ve worked with a lot of different muslim groups around america. i’ve met with a lot of them, and i’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that’s what i want to see. it’s also important i intend to defeat isis, to do so in a coalition with majority muslim nations. right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the americans? and this is a gift to isis and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. we are not at war with islam. and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. so i want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. ",0,False
667,TRUMP,"first of all, captain khan is an american hero, and if i were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, i would not have had our people in iraq. iraq was a disaster. so he would have been alive today. the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands—excuse me. excuse me.. ",1,False
669,TRUMP,why don’t you interrupt her? you interrupt me all the time. ,1,False
671,TRUMP,why don’t you interrupt her? ,1,False
673,TRUMP,"it’s called extreme vetting. we are going to areas like syria where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama. and hillary clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over obama. people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time. we have enough problems in this country. i believe in building safe zones. i believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. but i don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them. we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. ",1,False
675,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, first of all, i will not let anyone into our country that i think poses a risk to us. but there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the russian and syrian air forces. there are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, i believe, because of russian aggression. and we need to do our part. we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are. but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. but it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion. how do you do that? we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? and how do we expect to be able to implement those? so i thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. and indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. and the final thing i would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he’s denied being for the war in iraq. we have it on tape. the entire press corps has looked at it. it’s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.

684,TRUMP,"could i just respond to this, please? ",1,False
686,TRUMP,"hillary clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. when we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don’t want them. in some cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. and they don’t want them. and hillary clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that’s ok, we can’t force it into their country. let me tell you, i’m going to force them right back into their country. they’re murderers and some very bad people. and i will tell you very strongly, when bernie sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you’ve never seen. we’re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. at a record clip. and it shouldn’t be allowed to happen. ice just endorsed me. they’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. the border patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because i understand the border. she doesn’t. she wants amnesty for everybody. come right in. come right over. it’s a horrible thing she’s doing. she’s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the united states. that i can tell you. ",1,False
688,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, right. as i recall, that was something i said about abraham lincoln after having seen the wonderful steven spielberg movie called “lincoln.” it was a master class watching president lincoln get the congress to approve the 13th amendment. it was principled, and it was strategic. and i was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. and, yes, president lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. that was a great—i thought a great display of presidential leadership. but, you know, let’s talk about what’s really going on here, martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin, meaning putin and the russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on american accounts to influence our election. and wikileaks is part of that, as are other sites where the russians hack information, we don’t even know if it’s accurate information, and then they put it out. we have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. and believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. they’re doing it to try to influence the election for donald trump. now, maybe because he has praised putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in moscow, i don’t know the reasons. but we deserve answers. and we should demand that donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has… ",0,False

703,TRUMP,"of course i do. of course i do. and so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. i know many of her donors. her donors took massive tax write-offs. ",1,False
705,TRUMP,"a lot of my—excuse me, anderson—a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that hillary as a senator allowed. and she’ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. that’s why. see, i understand the tax code better than anybody that’s ever run for president. hillary clinton—and it’s extremely complex—hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to wall street people. but they really want the carried interest provision, which i believe hillary’s leaving. very interesting why she’s leaving carried interest. but i will tell you that, number one, i pay tremendous numbers of taxes. i absolutely used it. and so did warren buffett and so did george soros and so did many of the other people that hillary is getting money from. now, i won’t mention their names, because they’re rich, but they’re not famous. so we won’t make them famous. ",1,False
709,TRUMP,"and, again, bernie sanders, it’s really bad judgment. she has made bad judgment not only on taxes. she’s made bad judgments on libya, on syria, on iraq. i mean, her and obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of iraq, the vacuum they’ve left, that’s why isis formed in the first place. they started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, hillary. congratulations. great job.

726,TRUMP,excuse me. because she has been a disaster as a senator. a disaster. ,1,False
728,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, the situation in syria is catastrophic. and every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by assad in partnership with the iranians on the ground, the russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. and there is a determined effort by the russian air force to destroy aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the syrian rebels who are really holding out against the assad regime. russia hasn’t paid any attention to isis. they’re interested in keeping assad in power. so i, when i was secretary of state, advocated and i advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. we need some leverage with the russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. and we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. but i want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of russia. russia has decided that it’s all in, in syria. and they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the united states, too, and it’s not me. i’ve stood up to russia. i’ve taken on putin and others, and i would do that as president. i think wherever we can cooperate with russia, that’s fine. and i did as secretary of state. that’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. it’s how we got the sanctions on iran that put a lid on the iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. so i would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. but i do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the syrians and the russians and try to hold them accountable.

810,HILLARY CLINTON,"thank you. well, you’re right. this is one of the most important issues in this election. i want to appoint supreme court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. because i think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. and so i would want to see the supreme court reverse citizens united and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. donald doesn’t agree with that. i would like the supreme court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. i want a supreme court that will stick with roe v. wade and a woman’s right to choose, and i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality. now, donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse roe v. wade and reverse marriage equality. i think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. i want a supreme court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. i want a supreme court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. so i have very clear views about what i want to see to kind of change the balance on the supreme court. and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine supreme court justices. i think that was a dereliction of duty. i hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if i am so fortunate enough as to be president, i will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.

812,TRUMP,"justice scalia, great judge, died recently. and we have a vacancy. i am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of justice scalia. i’m looking for judges—and i’ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. but people that will respect the constitution of the united states. and i think that this is so important. also, the second amendment, which is totally under siege by people like hillary clinton. they’ll respect the second amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. so important to me. now, hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. so i will have in my race more than $100 million put in—of my money, meaning i’m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she’s doing. what i ask is this. so i’m putting in more than—by the time it’s finished, i’ll have more than $100 million invested. pretty much self-funding mine. we’re raising money for the republican party, and we’re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. i ask hillary, why doesn’t—she made $250 million by being in office. she used the power of her office to make a lot of money. why isn’t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don’t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? it’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, i think, be a nice sign to the american public. why aren’t you putting some money in? you have a lot of it. you’ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you’ve been in office. made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. so why aren’t you putting money into your own campaign? i’m just curious.

846,GEORGE W.

",0,False
859,KERRY,"anthony, i would not. i have laid out a different plan, because the president’s plan is not working. you see that every night on television. there’s chaos in iraq. king abdullah of jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can’t hold elections in iraq with the chaos that’s going on today. senator richard lugar, the republican chairman of the foreign relations committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in iraq by this administration has been incompetent. those are the republican chairman’s words. senator hagel of nebraska said that the handling of iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it’s in the zone of dangerous. those are the words of two republicans, respected, both on the foreign relations committee. now, i have to tell you, i would do something different. i would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn’t. he pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the u.n., pushed them away individually. two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the north atlantic council, which is the political arm of nato. they discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in iraq. did our administration push for the total training of iraq? no. were they silent? yes. was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? no, because they’ve always wanted this to be an american effort. you know, they even had the defense department issue a memorandum saying, “don’t bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren’t part of our original coalition.” now, that’s not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make america safer. i’m going to get the training done for our troops. i’m going to get the training of iraqis done faster. and i’m going to get our allies back to the table.

860,GEORGE W.

862,KERRY,"yes, sir, please. ladies and gentlemen, the right war was osama bin laden and afghanistan. that was the right place. and the right time was tora bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains. now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction. that was the reason congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime. now we have to succeed. i’ve always said that. i have been consistent. yes, we have to succeed, and i have a better plan to help us do it.

863,GEORGE W. BUSH,"first of all, we didn’t find out he didn’t have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons. and secondly, it’s a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only osama bin laden. the war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. that’s what the war on terror is about. of course, we’re going to find osama bin laden. we’ve already 75 percent of his people. and we’re on the hunt for him. but this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve. ",1,False
865,GEORGE W. BUSH,"no, i appreciate that. i — listen, i — we’ve got a great country. i love our values. and i recognize i’ve made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country. i remember when ronald reagan was the president; he stood on principle. somebody called that stubborn. he stood on principle standing up to the soviet union, and we won that conflict. yet at the same time, he was very — we were very unpopular in europe because of the decisions he made. i recognize that taking saddam hussein out was unpopular. but i made the decision because i thought it was in the right interests of our security. you know, i’ve made some decisions on israel that’s unpopular. i wouldn’t deal with arafat, because i felt like he had let the former president down, and i don’t think he’s the kind of person that can lead toward a palestinian state. and people in europe didn’t like that decision. and that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do. i believe palestinians ought to have a state, but i know they need leadership that’s committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism. i made a decision not to join the international criminal court in the hague, which is where our troops could be brought to — brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge. i don’t think we ought to join that. that was unpopular. and so, what i’m telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they’re right. we’ll continue to reach out. listen, there is 30 nations involved in iraq, some 40 nations involved in afghanistan. people love america. sometimes they don’t like the decisions made by america, but i don’t think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing. you don’t want to join the international criminal court just because it’s popular in certain capitals in europe. ",1,False
867,KERRY,"nikki, that’s a question that’s been raised by a lot of people around the country. let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president’s answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years. the president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, “under what circumstances would you send people to war?” and his answer was, “with a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done.” he didn’t do that. he broke that promise. we didn’t have enough forces. general shinseki, the army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand. and guess what? they retired general shinseki for telling him that. this president hasn’t listened. i went to meet with the members of the security council in the week before we voted. i went to new york. i talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding saddam hussein accountable. i came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting hans blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they’d be there with us. but the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, “nope. sorry, time for diplomacy is over. we’re going.” he rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he’d plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us. he didn’t. he broke his word.

869,GEORGE W.

871,KERRY,"you rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component. general shinseki had the wisdom to say, “you’re going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace.” the military’s job is to win the war. a president’s job is to win the peace. the president did not do what was necessary. didn’t bring in enough nation. didn’t deliver the help. didn’t close off the borders. didn’t even guard the ammo dumps. and now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.

873,KERRY,"is it randee? jacobs: yes, randee. iran sponsors terrorism and has missiles capable of hitting israel and southern europe. iran will have nuclear weapons in two to three years time. in the event that u.n. sanctions don’t stop this threat, what will you do as president? ",0,False
874,KERRY,"i don’t think you can just rely on u.n. sanctions, randee. but you’re absolutely correct, it is a threat, it’s a huge threat. and what’s interesting is, it’s a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with iraq, where there wasn’t a threat. if he’d let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn’t have 10 times the numbers of forces in iraq that we have in afghanistan chasing osama bin laden. meanwhile, while iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they’re doing that, north korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. for two years, the president didn’t even engage with north korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former secretary of defense william perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. we were safer before president bush came to office. now they have the bombs and we’re less safe. so what do we do? we’ve got to join with the british and the french, with the germans, who’ve been involved, in their initiative. we’ve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. but the president’s been slow to do that, even in russia. at his pace, it’s going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former soviet union. i’ve proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. and the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. it’s very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you’re busy developing a new one. i’m going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. and if we have to get tough with iran, believe me, we will get tough. ",0,False
876,GEORGE W. BUSH,"that answer almost made me want to scowl. he keeps talking about, “let the inspectors do their job.” it’s naive and dangerous to say that. that’s what the duelfer report showed. he was deceiving the inspectors. secondly, of course we’ve been involved with iran. i fully understand the threat. and that’s why we’re doing what he suggested we do: get the brits, the germans and the french to go make it very clear to the iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions. we’ve been doing that. let me talk about north korea. it is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with north korea. remember, he’s the person who’s accusing me of not acting multilaterally. he now wants to take the six-party talks we have — china, north korea, south korea, russia, japan and the united states — and undermine them by having bilateral talks. that’s what president clinton did. he had bilateral talks with the north koreans. and guess what happened? he didn’t honor the agreement. he was enriching uranium. that is a bad policy. of course, we’re paying attention to these. it’s a great question about iran. that’s why in my speech to the congress i said: there’s an “axis of evil,” iraq, iran and north korea, and we’re paying attention to it. and we’re making progress.

878,GEORGE W. BUSH,"yes, that’s a great question. thanks. i hear there’s rumors on the internets (sic) that we’re going to have a draft. we’re not going to have a draft, period. the all- volunteer army works. it works particularly when we pay our troops well. it works when we make sure they’ve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. an all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. we don’t need mass armies anymore. one of the things we’ve done is we’ve taken the — we’re beginning to transform our military. and by that i mean we’re moving troops out of korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. we don’t need as much manpower on the korean peninsula to keep a deterrent. in europe, we have massed troops as if the soviet union existed and was going to invade into europe, but those days are over with. and so we’re moving troops out of europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. so to answer your question is, we’re withdrawing, not from the world, we’re withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in america, so there’s less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be — we’ll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army. one of the more important things we’re doing in this administration is transformation. there are some really interesting technologies. for instance, we’re flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the united states. that saves manpower, and it saves equipment. it also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. now, forget all this talk about a draft. we’re not going to have a draft so long as i am the president.

880,KERRY,"daniel, i don’t support a draft. but let me tell you where the president’s policies have put us. the president — and this is one of the reasons why i am very proud in this race to have the support of general john shalikashvili, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; admiral william crowe, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; general tony mcpeak, who ran the air war for the president’s father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; general wes clark, who won the war in kosovo, supporting me; because they all — and general baca, who was the head of the national guard, supporting me. why? because they understand that our military is overextended under the president. our guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty. you’ve got people doing two and three rotations. you’ve got stop-loss policies, so people can’t get out when they were supposed to. you’ve got a back-door draft right now. and a lot of our military are underpaid. these are families that get hurt. it hurts the middle class. it hurts communities, because these are our first responders. and they’re called up. and they’re over there, not over here. now, i’m going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and i’m going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because i’m going to run a foreign policy that actually does what president reagan did, president eisenhower did, and others. we’re going to build alliances. we’re not going to go unilaterally. we’re not going to go alone like this president did.

BUSH,"i see it as a serious problem. i see it as a security issue, i see it as an economic issue, and i see it as a human-rights issue. we’re increasing the border security of the united states. we’ve got 1,000 more border patrol agents on the southern border. we’re using new equipment. we’re using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across. and we’ll continue to do so over the next four years. it’s a subject i’m very familiar with. after all, i was a border governor for a while. many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. they’re coming here to work. if you can make 50 cents in the heart of mexico, for example, or make $5 here in america, $5. 15, you’re going to come here if you’re worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. and that’s what’s happening. and so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, i believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there’s not an american willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers’ needs. that has the benefit of making sure our employers aren’t breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. it makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they’re not kept in the shadows of our society, that they’re able to go back and forth to see their families. see, the card, it’ll have a period of time attached to it. it also means it takes pressure off the border. if somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they’re not going to have to sneak across the border. it means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. now, it’s very important for our citizens to also know that i don’t believe we ought to have amnesty. i don’t think we ought to reward illegal behavior. there are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. and we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line. if they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too. and here is where my opponent and i differ. in september 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.

1059,GEORGE W. BUSH,"well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to september the 11th shows he doesn’t know the borders. they’re much better protected today than they were when i was the governor of texas. we have much more manpower and much more equipment there. he just doesn’t understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. that is an outrageous claim. and we’ll continue to protect our borders. we’re continuing to increase manpower and equipment.

1078,KERRY,"well, i think the fact that they’re facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there’s a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. our military is overextended. nine out of 10 active-duty army divisions are either in iraq, going to iraq or have come back from iraq. one way or the other, they’re wrapped up in it. now, i’ve proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the united states — one combat, one support. in addition, i’m going to double the number of special forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the national guard and reserve. and what i would like to do is see the national guard and reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. there’s much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. we ought to be doing that. and that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. but the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that america is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. i’ve said it before, i say it again: i believe the president broke faith with the american people in the way that he took this nation to war. he said he would work through a real alliance. he said in cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. well, we didn’t. and the result is our forces today are overextended. the fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. and america now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we’re finished and much more probably. and that is the result of this president taking his eye off of osama bin laden.

1080,GEORGE W. BUSH,"the best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in iraq, is to train iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we’re doing. we’ll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year. i remember going on an airplane in bangor, maine, to say thanks to the reservists and guard that were headed overseas from tennessee and north carolina, georgia. some of them had been there before. the people i talked to their spirits were high. they didn’t view their service as a back-door draft. they viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country. my opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy. in our first debate he proposed america pass a global test. in order to defend ourselves, we’d have to get international approval. that’s one of the major differences we have about defending our country. i’ll work with allies. i’ll work with friends. we’ll continue to build strong coalitions. but i will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries. we’ll be resolute, we’ll be strong, and we’ll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.

1322,MR. NIXON,"our policies are very different. i think that senator kennedy’s policies and recommendations for the handling of the castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he’s made during the course of this campaign. in effect, what senator kennedy recommends is that the united states government should give help to the exiles and to those within cuba who oppose the castro regime – provided they are anti-batista. now let’s just see what this means. we have five treaties with latin america, including the one setting up the organization of american states in bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other american country – and they as well have agreed to do likewise. the charter of the united nations – its preamble, article i and article ii – also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. now i don’t know what senator kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the castro regime, both in cuba and without. but i do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in latin america, we would probably be condemned in the united nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. i know something else. it would be an open invitation for mr. khrushchev to come in, to come into latin america and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. this is the major recommendation that he’s made. now, what can we do? well, we can do what we did with guatemala. there was a communist dictator that we inherited from the previous administration. we quarantined mr. arbenz. the result was that the guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. we are quarantining mr. castro today. we’re quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and senator kennedy’s suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. we are cutting off the significant items that the cuban regime needs in order to survive. by cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of cuba themselves will take care of mr. castro. but for us to do what senator kennedy has suggested would bring results which i know he would not want, and certainly which the american people would not want.

1325,MR.

1327,MR.

1329,MR. NIXON,"mr. cronkite, i naturally am aware of it, because i, of course, pay attention to everything senator kennedy says, as well as senator fulbright. now, in this connection i want to point out that the facts simply aren’t as stated. first of all, the report to which senator kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh – period immediately after sputnik. second, as far as this report is concerned, i would have no objection to having it made public. third, i would say this with regard to this report, with regard to gallup polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we’ve been hearing about “what about american prestige abroad”: america’s prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for america allow it to be. now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example – senator kennedy – stating over and over again that the united states is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight – we’ve had twenty-eight successful shots, they’ve had eight; when he states that we’re second in education, and i have seen soviet education and i’ve seen ours, and we’re not; that we’re second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we’re way ahead of the soviet union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in january of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to american prestige? well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. well let me make one thing clear. senator kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. every one of these items that i have mentioned he’s been wrong – dead wrong. and for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the united nations. now senator kennedy has referred to the vote on communist china. let’s look at the vote on hungary. there we got more votes for condemning hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. let’s look at the reaction eh – reaction to khrushchev and eisenhower at the last u.n. session. did khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? not at all. the president gained. america gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it’s that that keeps the prestige of america up, not running down america the way senator kennedy has been running her down.

1333,MR. KENNEDY,"yes, i think the next president of the united states should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one. i think we should go back to geneva, who’s ever elected president, mr. nixon or myself, and try once again. if we fail then, if we’re unable to come to an agreement – and i hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the united states, britain, france, and the soviet union as atomic powers. because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there’s some indications that by the time the next president’s term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. so one more effort should be made. i don’t think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. they can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. but i believe the effort should be made once more by who’s ever elected president of the united states. if we fail, it’s been a great serious failure for everyone – for the human race. i hope we can succeed. but then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the russians and then we’ll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the united states, and there may have to be testing underground. i think the atomic energy committee is prepared for it. there may be testing in outer space. i hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh – testing in the atmosphere. it’s possible to detect those kind of tests. the kind of tests which you can’t detect are underground or in – in uh – perhaps in outer space. so that i’m hopeful we can try once more. if we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. but i’m most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. china may have it by 1963, egypt. war has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, i believe means that we’re going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years. we ought to make one last effort.

1335,MR.

1337,MR. NIXON,"well the conditions i laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it’s rather difficult to be much more specific than that. uh – first of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. this means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. by adequate preparation i mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. i don’t believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from mr. khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. but let’s look at the other side of the coin. if we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if mr. khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up – as he did this one – because he isn’t going to get his way – we’d set back the cause of peace. we do not help it. we can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. i think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. and so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit – a spirit of geneva, or camp david, or whatever it is. when i say “phony spirit,” i mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the soviet union simply doesn’t intend to carry out what they say. now, these are the conditions that i can lay out. i cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what mr. khrushchev does and what he says uh – we cannot indicate what our plans will be.

1339,MR. KENNEDY,"well, i think the president of the united states last winter indicated that before he’d go to the summit in may he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. he hoped that there would be uh – b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. he also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in berlin. the soviet union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. i believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either berlin, outer space, or general disarmament – including nuclear testing. in addition, i believe the next president in january and february should go to work in building the strength of the united states. the soviet union does understand strength. we arm to parley, winston churchill said ten years ago. if we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over berlin – which we may in the spring, or in the winter – it’s important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we’re building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we’re determined to protect our commitment. and then i believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world. but until we’re strong here, until we’re moving here, i believe a summit could not be successful. i hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting. i think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in may.

1345,MR. NIXON,"i would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as senator kennedy persists in what i think is a fundamental error. he says he supports the president’s position. he says that he voted for the resolution. well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the united states to defend formosa and the offshore islands. but he also voted then for an amendment – which was lost, fortunately – an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on formosa. he repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. he repeated it again in a television debate that we had. now, my point is this: senator kennedy has got to be consistent here. either he’s for the president and he’s against the position that those who opposed the president in fifty-five and fifty-nine – and the senator’s position itself, stated the other day in our debate – either he is for the president and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. now if the senator in his answer to this question will say “i now will depart, or retract my previous views; i think i was wrong in i 955; i think i was wrong in 1959; and i think i was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out quemoy and matsu – draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the communists;” then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. i support the president’s position. i have always opposed drawing a line. i have opposed drawing a line because i know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the communists to attack – to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. and so i would hope that senator kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. it isn’t enough for him to say “i support the president’s position, that i voted for the resolution.” of course, he voted for the resolution – it was virtually unanimous. but the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. it’s very simple for him to clear it up. he can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. if he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.

FORD,"governor carter’s answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the associated press a week or so ago. in that interview uh – governor carter indicated that uh – he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. now if you uh – take the medium or middle-income taxpayer – that’s about $14 thousand per person – uh – governor carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. i think uh – the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. they have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh – added to the minimum tax uh – provision to make all people pay more taxes. i believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. mr. carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. now, the governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. the records show that president roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. president truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year. i understand that governor carter, when he was governor of georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year. my average in two years is twenty-six. but in the process of that we have saved uhh – $9 billion. and one final comment, uh – governor carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law. i must remind him the democrats have controlled the congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.

1426,MR. FORD,"there is a considerable anti-washington feeling throughout the country. but i think the feeling is misplaced. in the last two years, we have restored integrity in the white house, and we’ve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. the anti-washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the congress of the united states. for example, this congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. it – the next congress will probably be the first billion-dollar congress in the history of the united states. i don’t think the american people are getting their money’s worth from the majority party that run this congress. we, in addition, see that uh – in the last uh – four years the number of employees hired by the congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh – the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. and i don’t see any improvement in the performance of the congress under the present leadership. so it seems to me instead of the anti-washington feeling being aimed at everybody in washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the congress of the united states, and particularly the majority in the congress. they spend too much money on themselves. they have too many employees. there’s some question about their morality. it seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the house of representatives or for their united states senator. that’s where the problem is and i hope there’ll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the congress of the united states.

1430,MR. CARTER,"well, it’s not a matter of uh – republican and democrat. it’s a matter of leadership or no leadership. president eisenhower worked with a democratic congress very well. even president nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a democratic congress very well. uh – mr. ford has vetoed, as i said earlier, four times as many bills per year as mr. nixon. mr. ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the congress by working with the congress. i think under presidents for- uh – nixon and eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. this year mr. ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. this is government by stalemate, and we’ve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the congress, who collectively also represent this country. we’ve had uh – republican presidents before who’ve tried to run against a democratic – uh congress. and i don’t think it’s uh – the congress is mr. ford’s opponent; but if uh – if – if he insists that uh – that i be responsible for the democratic congress, of which i’m – have not been a part, then i think it’s only fair that he be responsible for the nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. that, i think, is a good balance. but the point is, that – that a president ought to lead this country. mr. ford, so far as i know, except for avoiding another watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. and there’s been a constant squabbling between the president and the congress, and that’s not the way this country ought to be run. i might go back to one other thing. mr. ford has uh – misquoted an ap uh – news story that was in error to begin with. that story reported several times that i would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh – that correction was delivered to the white house and i am sure that the president knows about this uh – correction, but he still insists uh – on repeating an erroneous statement.

1435,MR.

1446,MR. FORD,"on november second all of you will make a very, very important decision. one of the major issues in this campaign is trust. a president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he’s promised. a president can’t be all things to all people. a president should be the same thing to all people. another issue in this campaign, governor carter has endorsed the democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. governor carter has embraced the record of the present congress, dominated by his political party. it calls for more of the same. governor carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. i think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on november second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the white house. on the fourth of july we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday – for our great country. it was a superb occasion. it was a glorious day. in the first century of our nation’s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. in the second century of our nation’s history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million americans today and all that join us. in the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. we must make this next century the century of the individual. we should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. the individual worker in the plants throughout the united states should not be a small cog in a big machine. the member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. my mother and father, during the depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. betty and i have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the united states, our beloved country. you and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better america. i believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better america.

1449,HILLARY CLINTON,"thank you very much, chris. and thanks to unlv for hosting us. you know, i think when we talk about the supreme court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? what kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? what kind of rights will americans have? and i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. for me, that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community, that will stand up and say no to citizens united, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. i have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the supreme court. but i feel that at this point in our country’s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse roe v. wade, that we stand up against citizens united, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: the supreme court should represent all of us. that’s how i see the court, and the kind of people that i would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as americans. and i look forward to having that opportunity. i would hope that the senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that president obama has sent to them. that’s the way the constitution fundamentally should operate. the president nominates, and then the senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.

1451,TRUMP,"well, first of all, it’s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. the supreme court: it’s what it’s all about. our country is so, so—it’s just so imperative that we have the right justices. something happened recently where justice ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that i represent. and she was forced to apologize. and apologize she did. but these were statements that should never, ever have been made. we need a supreme court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment, and all amendments, but the second amendment, which is under absolute siege. i believe if my opponent should win this race, which i truly don’t think will happen, we will have a second amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. but i feel that it’s absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma. i feel that the justices that i am going to appoint—and i’ve named 20 of them—the justices that i’m going to appoint will be pro-life. they will have a conservative bent. they will be protecting the second amendment. they are great scholars in all cases, and they’re people of tremendous respect. they will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. and i believe that’s very, very important. i don’t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. it’s all about the constitution of—of—and so important, the constitution the way it was meant to be. and those are the people that i will appoint.

1617,HILLARY CLINTON,"he went on to say, “look at her. i don’t think so.” about another woman, he said, “that wouldn’t be my first choice.” he attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her “disgusting,” as he has called a number of women during this campaign. donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. he goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and i don’t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like. so we now know what donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. that’s who donald is. i think it’s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don’t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater. america is great, because america is good. and it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.

1619,TRUMP,nobody has more respect for women than i do. nobody. [laughter] nobody has more respect… ,1,False
1621,TRUMP,"and frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. and i really want to just talk about something slightly different. she mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. but i will tell you what isn’t fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the united states congress. what happened to the fbi, i don’t know. we have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the fbi. one lie. she’s lied hundreds of times to the people, to congress, and to the fbi. he’s going to probably go to jail. this is a four-star general. and she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the united states? that’s really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.

1623,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, every time donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. and it’s not just about women. he never apologizes or says he’s sorry for anything. so we know what he has said and what he’s done to women. but he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.

1746,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, chris, first of all, i think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. i’m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. this would not be done just on the first day. this would take a lot of negotiation. and it would also take making it clear to the russians and the syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. we’ve had millions of people leave syria and those millions of people inside syria who have been dislocated. so i think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in syria, it would help us with our fight against isis. but i want to respond to what donald said about refugees. he’s made these claims repeatedly. i am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. but i am not going to slam the door on women and children. that picture of that little 4-year-old boy in aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. and so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. that does not solve our internal challenges with isis and our need to stop radicalization, to work with american muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. in fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in orlando, the pulse nightclub, was born in queens, the same place donald was born. so let’s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. and, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in syria and iraq, and we’ve got to keep fighting, and i will defeat isis, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.

So I don’t want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.

1872,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress. I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about. The president’s terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years. What’s wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12? Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized. For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can’t do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together. We’ve got to do something about it. And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long. And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits. And how to get them passed? Send us some people that will pass the idea. And I think you will. I think the American people want it now. Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done. Actually, you’d have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads. ",1,False
1874,BILL CLINTON,"I know they’re popular, but I’m against them. I’ll tell you why. I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard. Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already. I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you’re going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise. Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can. You’re going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress. Now, let me tell you what I favor instead. I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we’re doing now. If you did that you could take away the incumbents’ advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight. So that’s how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we’d get the changes you want. ",0,False

FORD,"well, mr. kraft, uh – i violently disagree with your assessment. and i don’t think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to. uh – let me uh – talk about uh – the economic announcements that were made just this past week. yes, it was announced that the uh – gnp real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent. but do you realize that over the last ten years that’s a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period? now it’s lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it’s lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. but every economist – liberal, conservative that i’m familiar with – recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh – the first quarter of next year that we’ll have an increase in real gnp. but now let’s talk about the pluses that came out this week. we had an 18 percent increase in housing starts. we had a substantial increase in new permits for housing. as a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. now in addition, we had a very – some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation. and inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare. the rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh – 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent gnp was less than the 5.4 percent. it means that the american buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.

2181,MR. CARTER,"well, that’s not exactly an accurate description of what happened. when i was that far ahead, it was immediately following the democratic convention, and before the republican convention. at that time, uh – 25 or 30 percent of the reagan supporters said that they would not support president ford. but as occurred at the end of the con- democratic convention, the republican party unified itself. and i think immediately following the republican convention, there was about a ten-point spread. i believe that to be accurate, i had 49 percent; president ford, 39 percent. uh – the polls uh – are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another. and the only poll i’ve ever followed is the one that uh – you know, is taken on election day. i was in uh – thirty primaries in the spring, and uh – at first it was obvious that i didn’t have any standing in the poll. as a matter of fact, i think when gallup ran their first poll in december of 1975 they didn’t put my name on the list. they had thirty-five people on the list. my name wasn’t even there. and at the beginning of the year i had about 2 percent. so the polls to me are interesting, but they don’t determine, you know, my hopes or – or my despair. i campaign among people. i’ve never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. i have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around – hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. in georgia alone, for instance, i got 84 percent of the vote, and i think there were fourteen people uh – in addition to myself on the ballot, and governor wallace had been very strong in georgia. that’s an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. and today, we have about five hundred georgians at their own expense – just working people who believe in me – spread around the country uh – involved in the political campaign. so, the polls are interesting, but uh – i don’t know how to explain the fluctuation. i think a lot of it uh – depends on current events – uh – sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. but i think our hold uh – of support among those who uh – are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. and my success in the primary season was, i think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who’s from outside washington, who – who never has been a part of the washington establishment. and i think that we’ll have good results uh – on november the second for myself and i hope for the country.

2185,MR. FORD,"for twenty-five years i served in the congress under five presidents. i saw them work, i saw them make very hard decisions. i didn’t always agree with their decisions, whether they were democratic or republican presidents. for the last two years, i’ve been the president, and i have found from experience that it’s much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them. i became president at the time that the united states was in a very troubled time. we had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of vietnam. the american people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. that uh – situation called for me to first put the united states on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit america. i think most people know that i did not seek the presidency. but i am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years. during this campaign we’ve seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh – slogans of one kind or another. but those are not the things that count. what counts is, that the united states celebrated its 200th birthday on july fourth. as a result of that wonderful experience all over the united states, there is a new spirit in america. the american people are healed, are working together. the american people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. we have cut inflation by better than half. we have came out of the recession and we’re well on the road to real prosperity in this country again. there has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because i’ve been open, candid and forthright. i have never promised more than i could produce and i have produced everything that i promised. we are at peace. not a single young american is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight. we have peace with freedom. i’ve been proud to be president of the united states during these very troubled times. i love america just as all of you love america. it would be the highest honor for me to have your support on november second and for you to say, “jerry ford, you’ve done a good job, keep on doing it.” thank you, and good night.

2316,OBAMA,"senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger, who’s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with iran — guess what — without precondition. this is one of your own advisers. now, understand what this means “without preconditions.” it doesn’t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. what it means is that we don’t do what we’ve been doing, which is to say, “until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won’t have direct contacts with you.” there’s a difference between preconditions and preparation. of course we’ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because iran is a rogue regime. but i will point out that i was called naive when i suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with iran. and you know what? president bush recently sent a senior ambassador, bill burns, to participate in talks with the europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. again, it may not work, but if it doesn’t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that senator mccain just mentioned. and when we haven’t done it, as in north korea — let me just take one more example — in north korea, we cut off talks. they’re a member of the axis of evil. we can’t deal with them. and you know what happened? they went — they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. they tested a nuke. they tested missiles. they pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. and they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like syria. when we re-engaged — because, again, the bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in north korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. and — and i just — so i just have to make this general point that the bush administration, some of senator mccain’s own advisers all think this is important, and senator mccain appears resistant. he even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of spain, because he — you know, he wasn’t sure whether they were aligned with us. i mean, spain? spain is a nato ally.

2338,MCCAIN,"well, i was interested in senator obama’s reaction to the russian aggression against georgia. his first statement was, “both sides ought to show restraint.” again, a little bit of naivete there. he doesn’t understand that russia committed serious aggression against georgia. and russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a kgb apparatchik-run government. i looked into mr. putin’s eyes, and i saw three letters, a “k,” a “g,” and a “b.” and their aggression in georgia is not acceptable behavior. i don’t believe we’re going to go back to the cold war. i am sure that that will not happen. but i do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. and that wasn’t just about a problem between georgia and russia. it had everything to do with energy. there’s a pipeline that runs from the caspian through georgia through turkey. and, of course, we know that the russians control other sources of energy into europe, which they have used from time to time. it’s not accidental that the presidents of latvia, estonia, lithuania, poland, and ukraine flew to georgia, flew to tbilisi, where i have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, misha saakashvili. ",1,False
2339,MCCAIN,"and they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the russian threats to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empire. now, i think the russians ought to understand that we will support — we, the united states — will support the inclusion of georgia and ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into nato. we also ought to make it very clear that the russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. they have stationed additional troops in abkhazia and south ossetia. by the way, i went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. and this is — this is georgian territory. and there was a huge poster of vladimir putin, and it said, “vladimir putin, our president.” it was very clear, the russian intentions towards georgia. they were just waiting to seize the opportunity. so, this is a very difficult situation. we want to work with the russians. but we also have every right to expect the russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a — with a — with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. and watch ukraine. this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukraine, crimea, the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol. and the breakdown of the political process in ukraine between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a very serious problem. so watch ukraine, and let’s make sure that we — that the ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.

2365,MCCAIN,"i think it’s much less than it was the day after 9/11. i think it — that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. and i want to tell you that one of the things i’m most proud of, among others, because i have worked across the aisle. i have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. but after 9/11, senator joe lieberman and i decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. and we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where i differed with this administration. and we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on washington, and we got that legislation passed. and there were a series of recommendations, as i recall, more than 40. and i’m happy to say that we’ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. i’m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, democrat and republican alike. so we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. we have to do a better job in human intelligence. and we’ve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don’t ever torture a prisoner ever again. we have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. we have to work more closely with our allies. i know our allies, and i can work much more closely with them. but i can tell you that i think america is safer today than it was on 9/11. but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a long way to go. and i’d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we’ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the defense department. and i think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. but we still have a long way to go before we can declare america safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well. ",1,False
2367,OBAMA,"well, first of all, i think that we are safer in some ways. obviously, we’ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. we have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. we’ve got to make sure that we’re hardening our chemical sites. we haven’t done enough in terms of transit; we haven’t done enough in terms of ports. and the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. it’s in a suitcase. this is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. it is the — the biggest threat to the united states is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. and we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. and i actually believe that we need missile defense, because of iran and north korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but i also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we’re making a mistake. the other thing that we have to focus on, though, is al qaida. they are now operating in 60 countries. we can’t simply be focused on iraq. we have to go to the root cause, and that is in afghanistan and pakistan. that’s going to be critical. we are going to need more cooperation with our allies. and one last point i want to make. it is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. and one of the things that i intend to do as president is to restore america’s standing in the world. we are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago. ",0,False
2368,OBAMA,"and this is the greatest country on earth. but because of some of the mistakes that have been made — and i give senator mccain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security — because of those things, we, i think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that america is that shining beacon on a hill. ",0,False
2370,MCCAIN,"but in the case of missile defense, senator obama said it had to be, quote, “proven.” that wasn’t proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi, which is missile defense. and it was major — a major factor in bringing about the end of the cold war. we seem to come full circle again. senator obama still doesn’t quite understand — or doesn’t get it — that if we fail in iraq, it encourages al qaida. they would establish a base in iraq. the consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat — possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we’ve made of american blood and treasure, which grieves us all. all of that would be lost if we followed senator obama’s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. and general petraeus says we have had great success, but it’s very fragile. and we can’t do what senator obama wants to do. that is the central issue of our time. and i think americans will judge very seriously as to whether that’s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the united states. ",1,False
2374,OBAMA,"well, let me just make a closing point. you know, my father came from kenya. that’s where i get my name. and in the ’60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the united states because the notion was that there was no other country on earth where you could make it if you tried. the ideals and the values of the united states inspired the entire world. i don’t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the united states, is the same. and part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do — and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we’re going to keep america safe — is to — to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that — that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. and that is something that i’m going to be committed to as president of the united states.

2383,OBAMA,"we haven’t seen the language yet. and i do think that there’s constructive work being done out there. so, for the viewers who are watching, i am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. the question, i think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? two years ago, i warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. last year, i wrote to the secretary of the treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. so — so the question, i think, that we’ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we’ve got to solve this problem short term. and we are going to have to intervene; there’s no doubt about that. but we’re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? we did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. and that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad. ",0,False
2385,MCCAIN,i — i hope so. and i… ,1,False
2387,MCCAIN,sure. ,1,False
2389,MCCAIN,"sure. but — but let me — let me point out, i also warned about fannie mae and freddie mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and ceo pay, and all that. a lot of us saw this train wreck coming. but there’s also the issue of responsibility. you’ve mentioned president dwight david eisenhower. president eisenhower, on the night before the normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. one of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. and he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the united states army for the failure of the landings at normandy. somehow we’ve lost that accountability. i’ve been heavily criticized because i called for the resignation of the chairman of the securities and exchange commission. we’ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we’ve got to reward people who succeed. but somehow in washington today — and i’m afraid on wall street — greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption — or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. as president of the united states, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. and i promise you that that will happen.

2393,OBAMA,i do not think that they are. ,0,False
2396,MCCAIN,are you afraid i couldn’t hear him? (laughter) ,1,False
2400,MCCAIN,"no, i — look, we’ve got to fix the system. we’ve got fundamental problems in the system. and main street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in washington, d.c., and in the wall street. so there’s no doubt that we have a long way to go. and, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren’t doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. but i have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the american worker. and the american worker is the most productive, the most innovative. america is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. but we’ve got to get through these times, but i have a fundamental belief in the united states of america. and i still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.

2402,MCCAIN,"well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in washington. it’s completely out of control. it’s gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the great society. we republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. and the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, tom coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it’s a gateway. it’s a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. and we have former members of congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. you know, we spent $3 million to study the dna of bears in montana. i don’t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers’ money. and it has got to be brought under control. as president of the united states, i want to assure you, i’ve got a pen. this one’s kind of old. i’ve got a pen, and i’m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. i will make them famous. you will know their names. now, senator obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. he has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he’s been in the united states senate. i suggest that people go up on the web site of citizens against government waste, and they’ll look at those projects. that kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in washington, d.c. that’s one of the fundamental differences that senator obama and i have.

2452,MCCAIN,"i think the lessons of iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. our initial military success, we went in to baghdad and everybody celebrated. and then the war was very badly mishandled. i went to iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we’ve got to change this strategy. this strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and i fought for it. and finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. this strategy has succeeded. and we are winning in iraq. and we will come home with victory and with honor. and that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds. ",1,False
2453,MCCAIN,"and i want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. the consequences of defeat would have been increased iranian influence. it would have been increase in sectarian violence. it would have been a wider war, which the united states of america might have had to come back. so there was a lot at stake there. and thanks to this great general, david petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. and we are winning in iraq, and we will come home. and we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.

2457,MCCAIN,"the next president of the united states is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into iraq or not. the next president of the united states is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. that’s the decision of the next president of the united states. senator obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. but yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. incredibly, incredibly senator obama didn’t go to iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with general petraeus.

2490,OBAMA,"nobody talked about attacking pakistan. here’s what i said. and if john wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the united states has al qaida, bin laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. now, i think that’s the right strategy; i think that’s the right policy. and, john, i — you’re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. but, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for north korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing iran, i don’t know, you know, how credible that is. i think this is the right strategy. now, senator mccain is also right that it’s difficult. this is not an easy situation. you’ve got cross-border attacks against u.s. troops. and we’ve got a choice. we could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. and the problem, john, with the strategy that’s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled musharraf, we alienated the pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. we had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, “well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he’s our dictator.” and as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in pakistan. we spent $10 billion. and in the meantime, they weren’t going after al qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in afghanistan. that’s going to change when i’m president of the united states.

2501,OBAMA,"well, let me just correct something very quickly. i believe the republican guard of iran is a terrorist organization. i’ve consistently said so. what senator mccain refers to is a measure in the senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of iraq. to deal with iran. and ironically, the single thing that has strengthened iran over the last several years has been the war in iraq. iraq was iran’s mortal enemy. that was cleared away. and what we’ve seen over the last several years is iran’s influence grow. they have funded hezbollah, they have funded hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. so obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. senator mccain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran. it would be a game changer. not only would it threaten israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this middle east. now here’s what we need to do. we do need tougher sanctions. i do not agree with senator mccain that we’re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like russia and china that are, i think senator mccain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with iran but potentially have an interest in making sure iran doesn’t have a nuclear weapon. but we are also going to have to, i believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with iran and this is a major difference i have with senator mccain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. it has not worked in iran, it has not worked in north korea. in each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. that will change when i’m president of the united states.

2503,MCCAIN,"senator obama twice said in debates he would sit down with ahmadinejad, chavez and raul castro without precondition. without precondition. here is ahmadinenene (ph), ahmadinejad, who is, ahmadinejad, who is now in new york, talking about the extermination of the state of israel, of wiping israel off the map, and we’re going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they’ve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. the point is that throughout history, whether it be ronald reagan, who wouldn’t sit down with brezhnev, andropov or chernenko until gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. or whether it be nixon’s trip to china, which was preceded by henry kissinger, many times before he went. look, i’ll sit down with anybody, but there’s got to be pre-conditions. those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn’t legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like ahmadinejad. now, senator obama said, without preconditions. ",1,False
2504,OBAMA,"so let’s talk about this. first of all, ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in iran. so he may not be the right person to talk to. but i reserve the right, as president of the united states to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if i think it’s going to keep america safe. and i’m glad that senator mccain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy. ",0,False
2505,OBAMA,"senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger, who’s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with iran — guess what — without precondition. this is one of your own advisers. now, understand what this means “without preconditions.” it doesn’t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. what it means is that we don’t do what we’ve been doing, which is to say, “until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won’t have direct contacts with you.” there’s a difference between preconditions and preparation. of course we’ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because iran is a rogue regime. but i will point out that i was called naive when i suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with iran. and you know what? president bush recently sent a senior ambassador, bill burns, to participate in talks with the europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. again, it may not work, but if it doesn’t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that senator mccain just mentioned. and when we haven’t done it, as in north korea — let me just take one more example — in north korea, we cut off talks. they’re a member of the axis of evil. we can’t deal with them. and you know what happened? they went — they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. they tested a nuke. they tested missiles. they pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. and they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like syria. when we re-engaged — because, again, the bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in north korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. and — and i just — so i just have to make this general point that the bush administration, some of senator mccain’s own advisers all think this is important, and senator mccain appears resistant. he even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of spain, because he — you know, he wasn’t sure whether they were aligned with us. i mean, spain? spain is a nato ally.

",1,False
2509,OBAMA,of course not. ,0,False
2510,MCCAIN,"he said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. i’ve always encouraged them. the iranians have met with ambassador crocker in baghdad. what senator obama doesn’t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called israel a “stinking corpse,” and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. this is dangerous. it isn’t just naive; it’s dangerous. and so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. as far as north korea is concerned, our secretary of state, madeleine albright, went to north korea. by the way, north korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on earth. the average south korean is three inches taller than the average north korean, a huge gulag. we don’t know what the status of the dear leader’s health is today, but we know this, that the north koreans have broken every agreement that they’ve entered into. and we ought to go back to a little bit of ronald reagan’s “trust, but verify,” and certainly not sit down across the table from — without precondition, as senator obama said he did twice, i mean, it’s just dangerous. ",1,False
2511,OBAMA,"look, i mean, senator mccain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. nobody’s been talking about that, and senator mccain knows it. this is a mischaracterization of my position. when we talk about preconditions — and henry kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions — the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. and, you know, the bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn’t worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. and the notion that we would sit with ahmadinejad and not say anything while he’s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. nobody is even talking about that. ",0,False

2527,MCCAIN,"well, i was interested in senator obama’s reaction to the russian aggression against georgia. his first statement was, “both sides ought to show restraint.” again, a little bit of naivete there. he doesn’t understand that russia committed serious aggression against georgia. and russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a kgb apparatchik-run government. i looked into mr. putin’s eyes, and i saw three letters, a “k,” a “g,” and a “b.” and their aggression in georgia is not acceptable behavior. i don’t believe we’re going to go back to the cold war. i am sure that that will not happen. but i do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. and that wasn’t just about a problem between georgia and russia. it had everything to do with energy. there’s a pipeline that runs from the caspian through georgia through turkey. and, of course, we know that the russians control other sources of energy into europe, which they have used from time to time. it’s not accidental that the presidents of latvia, estonia, lithuania, poland, and ukraine flew to georgia, flew to tbilisi, where i have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, misha saakashvili. ",1,False
2528,MCCAIN,"and they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the russian threats to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empire. now, i think the russians ought to understand that we will support — we, the united states — will support the inclusion of georgia and ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into nato. we also ought to make it very clear that the russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. they have stationed additional troops in abkhazia and south ossetia. by the way, i went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. and this is — this is georgian territory. and there was a huge poster of vladimir putin, and it said, “vladimir putin, our president.” it was very clear, the russian intentions towards georgia. they were just waiting to seize the opportunity. so, this is a very difficult situation. we want to work with the russians. but we also have every right to expect the russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a — with a — with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. and watch ukraine. this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukraine, crimea, the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol. and the breakdown of the political process in ukraine between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a very serious problem. so watch ukraine, and let’s make sure that we — that the ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.

2554,MCCAIN,"i think it’s much less than it was the day after 9/11. i think it — that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. and i want to tell you that one of the things i’m most proud of, among others, because i have worked across the aisle. i have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. but after 9/11, senator joe lieberman and i decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. and we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where i differed with this administration. and we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on washington, and we got that legislation passed. and there were a series of recommendations, as i recall, more than 40. and i’m happy to say that we’ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. i’m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, democrat and republican alike. so we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. we have to do a better job in human intelligence. and we’ve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don’t ever torture a prisoner ever again. we have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. we have to work more closely with our allies. i know our allies, and i can work much more closely with them. but i can tell you that i think america is safer today than it was on 9/11. but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a long way to go. and i’d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we’ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the defense department. and i think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. but we still have a long way to go before we can declare america safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well. ",1,False
2556,OBAMA,"well, first of all, i think that we are safer in some ways. obviously, we’ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. we have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. we’ve got to make sure that we’re hardening our chemical sites. we haven’t done enough in terms of transit; we haven’t done enough in terms of ports. and the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. it’s in a suitcase. this is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. it is the — the biggest threat to the united states is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. and we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. and i actually believe that we need missile defense, because of iran and north korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but i also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we’re making a mistake. the other thing that we have to focus on, though, is al qaida. they are now operating in 60 countries. we can’t simply be focused on iraq. we have to go to the root cause, and that is in afghanistan and pakistan. that’s going to be critical. we are going to need more cooperation with our allies. and one last point i want to make. it is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. and one of the things that i intend to do as president is to restore america’s standing in the world. we are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago. ",0,False
2557,OBAMA,"and this is the greatest country on earth. but because of some of the mistakes that have been made — and i give senator mccain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security — because of those things, we, i think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that america is that shining beacon on a hill. ",0,False
2559,MCCAIN,"but in the case of missile defense, senator obama said it had to be, quote, “proven.” that wasn’t proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi, which is missile defense. and it was major — a major factor in bringing about the end of the cold war. we seem to come full circle again. senator obama still doesn’t quite understand — or doesn’t get it — that if we fail in iraq, it encourages al qaida. they would establish a base in iraq. the consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat — possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we’ve made of american blood and treasure, which grieves us all. all of that would be lost if we followed senator obama’s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. and general petraeus says we have had great success, but it’s very fragile. and we can’t do what senator obama wants to do. that is the central issue of our time. and i think americans will judge very seriously as to whether that’s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the united states.

So I do think we need to strengthen family. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby, she’s showing a certain compassion for family; when she reads to children, the same thing. I believe that discipline and respect for the law — all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that. I’m appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces — it happens in families, it’s happened in ours. But it’s gotten too much. And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family. It can be a single-parent family. Those mothers need help. And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers — that will help strengthen the American family. And there’s a whole bunch of other things that I can’t click off in this short period of time. ",1,False
2576,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"No, I don’t think that’s the right answer. I don’t believe legalizing narcotics is the answer. I just don’t believe that’s the answer. I do believe that there’s some fairly good news out there. The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down. But we’ve got to keep fighting on this war against drugs. We’re doing a little better in interdiction. Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US’ problem — if you’d get the demand down, then we wouldn’t have the problem — are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military. We’re using the military more now in terms of interdiction. Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts. Where we’re not making the progress, Sander, is in — we’re making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children. But where we’re not making it is with the confirmed addicts. And I’ll tell you one place that’s working well, and that is the private sector — Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it. I’ll tell the American people, but this man said I’ll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something that’s very hard for the government to do. And he went out and he did it. And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldn’t use drugs. So we’re still in the fight. But I must tell you, I think legalization of narcotics, or something of that nature, in the face of the medical evidence, would be totally counterproductive. And I oppose it, and I’m going to stand up and continue to oppose it. (APPLAUSE) ",1,False

I’m very proud of him. But I can tell you this. If drugs were legal, I don’t think he’d be alive today. I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs. He is alive today because of the criminal justice system. That’s a mistake. What should we do? First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street. Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime. Now there are three crimes for every policeman. We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they’re severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals. There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems. That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president. (APPLAUSE) ",0,False
2590,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Coming from the political process. We have increased funding for AIDS. We’ve doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it. My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS — ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim. I think that we’re showing the proper compassion and concern. So I can’t tell you where it’s coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we’ve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem. We’re funding them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I wish there was more money — but we’re funding them far more than any time in the past, and we’re going to keep on doing that. I don’t know. I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, “Now if you see something we’re not doing, get ahold of me. Call me, let me know.” He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down. So he’s replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel. It was a beautiful moment and I think she’ll do a first-class job on that commission. So I think the appeal is yes, we care. And the other thing is part of AIDS — it’s one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, “Well, change your behavior. Is the behavior you’re using prone to cause AIDS? Change the behavior.” Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, “Bush ought to change his behavior.” You can’t talk about it rationally. The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause. To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I’m sorry, I think it sets back the cause. We cannot move to the extreme. We’ve got to care. We’ve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level. Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS. And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care. Do not go to the extreme. (APPLAUSE) ",1,False

We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we’re doing everything we can on research and treatment. And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive. This is a matter of life and death. I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children. I know it’s tough. The reason Magic Johnson resigned from the AIDS Commission is because the statement you heard tonight from Mr. Bush is the longest and best statement he’s made about it in public.

2616,GEORGE H.W. BUSH,"Let me tell you a little what it’s like to be president. In the Oval Office, you can’t predict what kind of crisis is going to come up. You have to make tough calls. You can’t be on one hand this way and one hand another. You can’t take different positions on these difficult issues. And then you need a philosophical — I’d call it a philosophical underpinning. Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is no more and we’re working with a democratic country. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free. Take a look at the Middle East. We had to stand up against a tyrant. The US came together as we haven’t in many, many years. And we kicked this man out of Kuwait. And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East. Nobody would have dreamed it possible. And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war. Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. All this is good. On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people — not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. We don’t need to do that any more. What we need to do is empower people. We need to invest and save. We need to do better in education. We need to do better in job retraining. We need to expand our exports, and they’re going very, very well, indeed. And we need to strengthen the American family. I hope as president that I’ve earned your trust. I’ve admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems. I hope I’ve earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character. And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job. Thank you very, very much.

2807,ROMNEY,"and there was no demonstration involved. it was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the american people. whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn’t know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn’t we know five days later when the ambassador to the united nations went on tv to say that this was a demonstration. how could we have not known? but i find more troubling than this, that on — on the day following the assassination of the united states ambassador, the first time that’s happened since 1979, when — when we have four americans killed there, when apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to las vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to colorado for another event, other political event. i think these — these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you’d hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. we’ve read their accounts now about what happened. it was very clear this was not a demonstration. this was an attack by terrorists. and this calls into question the president’s whole policy in the middle east. look what’s happening in syria, in egypt, now in libya. consider the distance between ourselves and — and israel, the president said that — that he was going to put daylight between us and israel. we have iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. syria — syria’s not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic — strategically significant player for america. the president’s policies throughout the middle east began with an apology tour and — and — and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.

2882,ROMNEY,"thank you, and that’s an opportunity for me, and i appreciate it. in the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they’d like to do. in the course of that, i think the president’s campaign has tried to characterize me as — as someone who’s very different than who i am. i care about 100 percent of the american people. i want 100 percent of the american people to have a bright and prosperous future. i care about our kids. i understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for america again. i spent my life in the private sector, not in government. i’m a guy who wants to help with the experience i have, the american people. my — my passion probably flows from the fact that i believe in god. and i believe we’re all children of the same god. i believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. i — i served as a missionary for my church. i served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. i’ve sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. i went to the olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. and as governor of my state, i was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults. i was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.

2891,MR. NIXON,"mr. smith, senator kennedy. the things that senator kennedy has said many of us can agree with. there is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the united states without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. there is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the kremlin, but the men in peking. we’re ahead in this competition, as senator kennedy, i think, has implied. but when you’re in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. and i subscribe completely to the spirit that senator kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the united states should move ahead. where, then, do we disagree? i think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the united states has been standing still. we heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. now last year, of course, was 1958. that happened to be a recession year. but when we look at the growth of g.n.p. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it’s six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. more about that later. looking then to this problem of how the united states should move ahead and where the united states is moving, i think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: let’s look at the record. is the united states standing still? is it true that this administration, as senator kennedy has charged, has been an administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. well, we have a comparison that we can make. we have the record of the truman administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the eisenhower administration. when we compare these two records in the areas that senator kennedy has – has discussed tonight, i think we find that america has been moving ahead. let’s take schools. we have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. let’s take hydroelectric power. we have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. let us take hospitals. we find that more have been built in this administration than in the previous administration. the same is true of highways. let’s put it in terms that all of us can understand. we often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may i say that when we compare the growth in this administration with that of the previous administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. that shows that there’s been more growth in this administration than in its predecessor. but let’s not put it there; let’s put it in terms of the average family. what has happened to you? we find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the eisenhower administration as they did in the truman administration. what about the prices you pay? we find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the truman administration as they did in the eisenhower administration. what’s the net result of this? this means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the eisenhower years as against two per cent in the truman years. now, this is not standing still. but, good as this record is, may i emphasize it isn’t enough. a record is never something to stand on. it’s something to build on. and in building on this record, i believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. and i think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. senator kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. i respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. but on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. they seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the truman administration which preceded it. and i would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. what kind of programs are we for? we are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. we are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are – is – are much – is much better handled than it is at the present time. here again, may i indicate that senator kennedy and i are not in disagreement as to the aims. we both want to help the old people. we want to see that they do have adequate medical care. the question is the means. i think that the means that i advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. i could give better examples, but for – for whatever it is, whether it’s in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move america, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. now, when we look at these programs, might i suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you’re spending. i will concede that in all the areas to which i have referred senator kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than i would have it spend. i costed out the cost of the democratic platform. it runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we’re presently spending. now the republican platform will cost more too. it will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we’re presently spending. now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? not at all. because it isn’t a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn’t a question of which government does the most. it is a question of which administration does the right thing. and in our case, i do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free americans. i believe the programs that senator kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, i believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. the final point that i would like to make is this: senator kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. i know what it means to be poor. i know what it means to see people who are unemployed. i know senator kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as i do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for america but only about the means to reach those goals.

2893,MR. KENNEDY,"well, the vice president and i came to the congress together 1946; we both served in the labor committee. i’ve been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh – government is comparable. secondly, i think the question is uh – what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? i come out of the democratic party, which in this century has produced woodrow wilson and franklin roosevelt and harry truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which i’ve discussed tonight. mr. nixon comes out of the republican party. he was nominated by it. and it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the tennessee valley, development of our natural resources. i think mr. nixon is an effective leader of his party. i hope he would grant me the same. the question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the united states? ",0,False
2896,MR. KENNEDY,"well, i would say in the latter that the – and that’s what i found uh – somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh – mr. nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the truman administration. you – mr. truman came to office in nineteen uh – forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh – difficulties that were facing the united states during that period of transition – 1946 when price controls were lifted – so it’s rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. i prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the democrats and the eight years of the republicans to show an overall period of growth. in regard to uh – price stability uh – i’m not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. in regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, i am chairman of the subcommittee on africa and i think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. i think it’s true of latin america also. we did come forward with a program of students for the congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of africa the previous year, so that i don’t think that uh – we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.

2918,MR. NIXON,"well obviously my views are a little different. first of all, i don’t see how it’s possible for a one-third of a body, such as the republicans have in the house and the senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. i would say, too, that when senator kennedy refers to the action of the house rules committee, there are eight democrats on that committee and four republicans. it would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four republicans for the eight democrats’ not getting a something through that particular committee. i would say further that to blame the president in his veto power for the inability of the senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh – misses the mark. when the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the congress. because let’s consider it. if the majority of the members of the congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues – the majority of those who were democrats – why didn’t they pass them and send to the president and get a veto and have an issue? the reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the president was against them; it was because the people were against them. it was because they were too extreme. and i am convinced that the alternate proposals that i have, that the republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh – without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next congress. ",1,False
2923,MR. KENNEDY,"well, i think they’re serious. i think it’s a matter that we should continue to uh – give uh – great care and attention to. we should support uh – the laws which the united states has passed in order to protect us from uh – those who would destroy us from within. we should sustain uh – the department of justice in its efforts and the f.b.i., and we should be continually alert. i think if the united states is maintaining a strong society here in the united states, i think that we can meet any internal threat. the major threat is external and will continue. ",0,False
2937,MR. MONDALE,"i believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in central america. our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. to do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. that’s one of the big disagreements that we have with the president — that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within el salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace this brings up the whole question of what presidential leadership is all about. i think the lesson in central america, this recent embarrassment in nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest — all of this has strengthened our opponents. a president must not only assure that we’re tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. we saw the same thing in lebanon, where we spent a good deal of america’s assets. but because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. the bottom line of national strength is that the president must be in command, he must lead. and when a president doesn’t know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn’t know that most soviet missiles were on land — these are things a president must know to command. a president is called the commander in chief. and he’s called that because he’s supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation. ",0,False
2939,MR. MONDALE,"we absolutely must, which is why i responded to your first question the way i did. it’s much more complex. you must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength — and all at the same time. that’s why i object to the covert action in nicaragua. that’s a classic example of a strategy that’s embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region. strength requires knowledge, command. we’ve seen in the nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.

2941,MR. REAGAN,"no, but i’m glad you asked that question, because i know it’s on many peoples’ minds. i have ordered an investigation. i know that the cia is already going forward with one. we have a gentleman down in nicaragua who is on contract to the cia, advising — supposedly on military tactics — the contras. and he drew up this manual. it was turned over to the agency head of the cia in nicaragua to be printed. and a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to cia, where more pages were excised before it was printed. but some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the cia. now, those are the details as we have them. and as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that. we’ll take the proper action at the proper time. i was very interested to hear about central america and our process down there, and i thought for a moment that instead of a debate i was going to find mr. mondale in complete agreement with what we’re doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we’ve been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout central america and working closely with the contadora group. so, i can only tell you about the manual — that we’re not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt. but if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.

2947,MR. REAGAN,"yes. i have so many things there to respond to, i’m going to pick out something you said earlier. you’ve been all over the country repeating something that, i will admit, the press has also been repeating — that i believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back. i never, ever conceived of such a thing. i never said any such thing. in a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, i said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that — or carriers — that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles. but i hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false. how anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, i think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been. so, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record. i’m sure that you appreciate that.

2968,MR. MONDALE,"no. as a matter of fact, i believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country. and we can see that in both lebanon and in central america. in lebanon, this president exercised american power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the soviet union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened. and it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the american public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did. similarly, in central america: what we’re doing in nicaragua with this covert war — which the congress, including many republicans, have tried to stop — is finally end up with a public definition of american power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest. we have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the world court because they’ll find us guilty of illegal actions. and our enemies are strengthened from all of this. we need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy. we are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us. it is only in that way that we can persevere. nicaragua ",0,False

2972,MR. REAGAN,"no, morton, i don’t agree to all of those things. first of all, when we and our allies — the italians, the french, and the united kingdom — went into lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the lebanese government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. but the first — pardon me — the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in beirut between israel and the plo terrorists. israel could not be blamed for that. those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and israel chased them all the way to there. then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from lebanon. we departed. and then the government of lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders. and we were succeeding. we were there for the better part of a year. our position happened to be at the airport. oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. i will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. and this is what we did. we never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there. but we were succeeding to the point that the lebanese government had been organized — if you will remember, there were the meetings in geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan. we were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began. there are forces there — and that includes syria, in my mind — who don’t want us to succeed, who don’t want that kind of a peace with a dominant lebanon, dominant over its own territory. and so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: we withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. but we went in in the interest of peace and to keep israel and syria from getting into the sixth war between them. and i have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.

2974,MR.

",1,False
2981,MR. REAGAN,"yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks. and the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based. you put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later. so, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those. and then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles. the soviet union, to our surprise — and not just mine — made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three. and we agreed. we said, “all right, if that’s what you want to do.” but it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had. so, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based? but even after we gave in and said, “all right, let’s discuss it all,” they walked away from the table. we didn’t. the president’s age mr. trewhitt. mr. mondale, i’m going to hang in there. should the president’s age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?

2982,MR. MONDALE,"no. and i have not made it an issue, nor should it be. what’s at issue here is the president’s application of his authority to understand what a president must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. a minute ago the president quoted cicero, i believe. i want to quote somebody a little closer to home, harry truman. he said, “the buck stops here.” we just heard the president’s answer for the problems at the barracks in lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. what happened? first, the joint chiefs of staff went to the president, said, “don’t put those troops there.” they did it. and then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the president, through the secretary of defense, and said, “please, mr. president, take those troops out of there because we can’t defend them.” they didn’t do it. and we know what happened. after that, once again, our embassy was exploded. this is the fourth time this has happened — an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings — even public warnings — from the terrorists. who’s in charge? who’s handling this matter? that’s my main point. now, on arms control, we’re completing 4 years. this is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. we have an arms race underway instead. a president has to lead his government or it won’t be done. different people with different views fight with each other. for 3\1/2\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. and we have this arms race underway. and a recent book that just came out by perhaps the nation’s most respected author in this field, strobe talbott, called “deadly gambits,” concludes that this president has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. that’s why they call the president the commander in chief. good intentions, i grant. but it takes more than that. you must be tough and smart. the president’s leadership mr. trewhitt. this question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already. and the president, mr. mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases — weak, i believe. it is a question of leadership. and he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the reverend jackson, particularly in central america. did you approve of his diplomatic activity? and are you prepared to repudiate him now?

REAGAN,"morton, i did criticize the president because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally — the shah of iran. and i am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. the shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the middle east for quite some time, and i did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. have things gotten better? the shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners — things of that kind. but we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. the matter of somoza — no, i never defended somoza. and, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did i — not that i could have done anything in my position at that time — but for this revolution to take place. and the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press. and then, just as castro had done in cuba, the sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution. many of them are now the contras. they exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some. and they installed a marxist-leninist totalitarian government. and what i have to say about this is, many times — and this has to do with the philippines, also, i know there are things there in the philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? it is a large communist movement to take over the philippines. they have been our friend since their inception as a nation. and i think that we’ve had enough of a record of letting — under the guise of revolution — someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative. and i think that we’re better off, for example with the philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a communist power in the pacific.

3033,MR. MONDALE,"i believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels. i would like to see their elimination. and in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the soviet union never tempts us. now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality. the president says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons. but, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history. he says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody’s going to get hurt. well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that. but why start an arms race now? why destabilize our relationship? why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend? why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war? a president, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what’s going on. i accept his objective and his dream; we all do. but the hard reality is that we must know what we’re doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time. he’s opposed every effort of every president to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he’s failed to do so. and if you want a tough president who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for walter mondale.

And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we’re doing exactly that. And so I believe that we’ve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers’ union. What’s happening up there? (Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this. It says let’s give parents the choice of a public, private or public school — public, private or religious school. And it works- -it works in Milwaukee. Democratic woman up there — taking the lead in this. The mayor up there, on the program. And the schools that are not chosen are improved — competition does that.

But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. And I believe you’re right on to something, that if we don’t change the education we’re not going to be able to compete. Federal funding for education is up substantially — Pell grants are up. But it isn’t going to get the job done if we don’t change K through 12. ",1,False

[applause] i will release my tax returns. and that’s against—my lawyers, they say, “don’t do it.” i will tell you this. no—in fact, watching shows, they’re reading the papers. almost every lawyer says, you don’t release your returns until the audit’s complete. when the audit’s complete, i’ll do it. but i would go against them if she releases her e-mails.

3480,TRUMP,that makes me smart. ,1,False
3481,HILLARY CLINTON,"so if he’s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. and i think probably he’s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide. and the financial disclosure statements, they don’t give you the tax rate. they don’t give you all the details that tax returns would. and it just seems to me that this is something that the american people deserve to see. and i have no reason to believe that he’s ever going to release his tax returns, because there’s something he’s hiding. and we’ll guess. we’ll keep guessing at what it might be that he’s hiding. but i think the question is, were he ever to get near the white house, what would be those conflicts? who does he owe money to? well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.

3483,HILLARY CLINTON,"i do. you know, i made a mistake using a private e- mail. ",0,False
3484,TRUMP,that’s for sure. ,1,False
3485,HILLARY CLINTON,"and if i had to do it over again, i would, obviously, do it differently. but i’m not going to make any excuses. it was a mistake, and i take responsibility for that. ",0,False
3487,TRUMP,"that was more than a mistake. that was done purposely. ok? that was not a mistake. that was done purposely. when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment, taking the fifth so they’re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth, i think it’s disgraceful. and believe me, this country thinks it’s—really thinks it’s disgraceful, also. as far as my tax returns, you don’t learn that much from tax returns. that i can tell you. you learn a lot from financial disclosure. and you should go down and take a look at that. the other thing, i’m extremely underleveraged. the report that said $650—which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that’s really not a lot of money. it’s not a lot of money relative to what i had. the buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was—actually, it wasn’t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. and the $650 isn’t even on that. but it’s not $650. it’s much less than that. but i could give you a list of banks, i would—if that would help you, i would give you a list of banks. these are very fine institutions, very fine banks. i could do that very quickly. i am very underleveraged. i have a great company. i have a tremendous income. and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way. it’s because it’s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. when we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country’s a mess, you know, it’s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything’s in great shape, our airports. our airports are like from a third world country. you land at laguardia, you land at kennedy, you land at lax, you land at newark, and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from china, you see these incredible airports, and you land—we’ve become a third world country. so the worst of all things has happened. we owe $20 trillion, and we’re a mess. we haven’t even started. and we’ve spent $6 trillion in the middle east, according to a report that i just saw. whether it’s 6 or 5, but it looks like it’s 6, $6 trillion in the middle east, we could have rebuilt our country twice. and it’s really a shame. and it’s politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem. our country has tremendous problems. we’re a debtor nation. we’re a serious debtor nation. and we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. and we don’t have the money, because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.

3490,TRUMP,"it would be squandered, too, believe me. ",1,False

3495,HILLARY CLINTON,"do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them? i can only say that i’m certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. he provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. and when we talk about your business, you’ve taken business bankruptcy six times. there are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. you call yourself the king of debt. you talk about leverage. you even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the united states.

3497,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, sometimes there’s not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. ",0,False
3499,HILLARY CLINTON,and we need to be very clear about that. ,0,False
3500,TRUMP,"so, yeah, i think—i do think it’s time. look, it’s all words, it’s all sound bites. i built an unbelievable company. some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the united states, in europe, lots of different places. it’s an unbelievable company. but on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. and when secretary clinton talks about people that didn’t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. now, if you want to change the laws, you’ve been there a long time, change the laws. but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because i’m running a company. my obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. and that’s what i do. but what she doesn’t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. i’ll give you an example. we’re just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house, so if i don’t get there one way, i’m going to get to pennsylvania avenue another. but we’re opening the old post office. under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. i’m a year ahead of schedule. and that’s what this country should be doing. we build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they’re supposed to cost. we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don’t have people that know what they’re doing. when we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. the trump international is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. and we should be able to do that for our country. ",1,False
3506,TRUMP,"no, you’re wrong. it went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. it was taken away from her. and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. they would have won an appeal. if you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it’s allowed. ",1,False
3513,TRUMP,ugh. ,1,False
3516,HILLARY CLINTON,"lester, i think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. i think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. and therefore, i think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am i feeling this way? but when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, i have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. i’ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. they admit it’s an issue. they’ve got a lot of concerns. mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. they want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. and i think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.

3518,TRUMP,i’d like to respond to that. ,1,False

3525,HILLARY CLINTON,"new york—new york has done an excellent job. and i give credit—i give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. and other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. look, one murder is too many. but it is important that we learn about what has been effective. and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? but let’s also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. and so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.

3536,HILLARY CLINTON,"i think—i think—i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and, yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that’s a good thing. [applause] ",0,False
3538,TRUMP,"i’ll tell you very—well, just very simple to say. sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of secretary clinton. and her campaign manager, patti doyle, went to—during the campaign, her campaign against president obama, fought very hard. and you can go look it up, and you can check it out. and if you look at cnn this past week, patti solis doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened. blumenthal sent mcclatchy, highly respected reporter at mcclatchy, to kenya to find out about it. they were pressing it very hard. she failed to get the birth certificate. when i got involved, i didn’t fail. i got him to give the birth certificate. so i’m satisfied with it. and i’ll tell you why i’m satisfied with it.

3542,TRUMP,yeah. ,1,False
3546,TRUMP,"well, it was very—i say nothing. i say nothing, because i was able to get him to produce it. he should have produced it a long time before. i say nothing. but let me just tell you. when you talk about healing, i think that i’ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the african-american community. i think you can see that. and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.

3554,HILLARY CLINTON,… have said that donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. it’s comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face. ,0,False
3558,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, i think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. i have put forth a plan to defeat isis. it does involve going after them online. i think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent isis and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and europe and elsewhere. but we also have to intensify our air strikes against isis and eventually support our arab and kurdish partners to be able to actually take out isis in raqqa, end their claim of being a caliphate. we’re making progress. our military is assisting in iraq. and we’re hoping that within the year we’ll be able to push isis out of iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in syria. but we have to be cognizant of the fact that they’ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. and i would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. i was involved in a number of efforts to take out al qaida leadership when i was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin laden. and i think we need to go after baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. because we’ve got to defeat isis, and we’ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.

3562,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, i hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. donald supported the invasion of iraq. ",0,False

3564,HILLARY CLINTON,that is absolutely proved over and over again. ,0,False
3565,TRUMP,wrong. wrong. ,1,False
3566,HILLARY CLINTON,"he actually advocated for the actions we took in libya and urged that gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. but the larger point—and he says this constantly—is george w. bush made the agreement about when american troops would leave iraq, not barack obama. and the only way that american troops could have stayed in iraq is to get an agreement from the then-iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the iraqi government would not give that. but let’s talk about the question you asked, lester. the question you asked is, what do we do here in the united states? that’s the most important part of this. how do we prevent attacks? how do we protect our people? and i think we’ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. i was so proud of law enforcement in new york, in minnesota, in new jersey. you know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by rahami. and they brought him down. and we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. so we’ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from europe, from the middle east. that means we’ve got to work more closely with our allies, and that’s something that donald has been very dismissive of. we’re working with nato, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. we’re working with our friends in the middle east, many of which, as you know, are muslim majority nations. donald has consistently insulted muslims abroad, muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with muslim nations and with the american muslim community. they’re on the front lines. they can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. they need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of donald’s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.

3570,TRUMP,"the secretary said very strongly about working with—we’ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone’s ever seen. you look at the middle east, it’s a total mess. under your direction, to a large extent. but you look at the middle east, you started the iran deal, that’s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, i mean, they were doing so badly. they were choking on the sanctions. and now they’re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they’re going. but when you look at nato, i was asked on a major show, what do you think of nato? and you have to understand, i’m a businessperson. i did really well. but i have common sense. and i said, well, i’ll tell you. i haven’t given lots of thought to nato. but two things. number one, the 28 countries of nato, many of them aren’t paying their fair share. number two—and that bothers me, because we should be asking—we’re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they’re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. and, number two, i said, and very strongly, nato could be obsolete, because—and i was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times, which is unusual for the new york times, to be honest—but i said, they do not focus on terror. and i was very strong. and i said it numerous times. and about four months ago, i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division. and i think that’s great. and i think we should get—because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato. it’s a lot of money to protect other people. but i’m all for nato. but i said they have to focus on terror, also. and they’re going to do that. and that was—believe me—i’m sure i’m not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato. i think we have to get nato to go into the middle east with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of isis, and we have to do it fast, when isis formed in this vacuum created by barack obama and secretary clinton. and believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. not only that, you named the day. they couldn’t believe it. they sat back probably and said, i can’t believe it. they said… ",1,False

3594,TRUMP,"wait. the afl-cio the other day, behind the blue screen, i don’t know who you were talking to, secretary clinton, but you were totally out of control. i said, there’s a person with a temperament that’s got a problem. ",1,False
3596,HILLARY CLINTON,"whew, ok. [laughter] let’s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by donald, first, nato. you know, nato as a military alliance has something called article 5, and basically it says this: an attack on one is an attack on all. and you know the only time it’s ever been invoked? after 9/11, when the 28 nations of nato said that they would go to afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. with respect to iran, when i became secretary of state, iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the bush administration. they had built covert facilities. they had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. and we had sanctioned them. i voted for every sanction against iran when i was in the senate, but it wasn’t enough. so i spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included russia and china to impose the toughest sanctions on iran. and we did drive them to the negotiating table. and my successor, john kerry, and president obama got a deal that put a lid on iran’s nuclear program without firing a single shot. that’s diplomacy. that’s coalition-building. that’s working with other nations. the other day, i saw donald saying that there were some iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of iran, and they were taunting american sailors who were on a nearby ship. he said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, i’d blow them out of the water and start another war. that’s not good judgment. ",0,False
3597,TRUMP,that would not start a war. ,1,False
3598,HILLARY CLINTON,"that is not the right temperament to be commander-in-chief, to be taunted. and the worst part… ",0,False
3599,TRUMP,"no, they were taunting us. ",1,False
3600,HILLARY CLINTON,"… of what we heard donald say has been about nuclear weapons. he has said repeatedly that he didn’t care if other nations got nuclear weapons, japan, south korea, even saudi arabia. it has been the policy of the united states, democrats and republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. he even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in east asia, well, you know, that’s fine… ",0,False
3601,TRUMP,wrong. ,1,False
3602,HILLARY CLINTON,"… have a good time, folks. ",0,False
3603,TRUMP,it’s lies. ,1,False
3604,HILLARY CLINTON,"and, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. that is the number-one threat we face in the world. and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. so a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as i think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. ",0,False
3605,TRUMP,"that line’s getting a little bit old, i must say. i would like to… ",1,False
3606,HILLARY CLINTON,"it’s a good one, though. it well describes the problem. [laughter] ",0,False
3609,TRUMP,"well, wait, but it’s very important. all i said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. we’re a country that owes $20 trillion. they have to help us out. ",1,False
3611,TRUMP,"as far as the nuclear is concerned, i agree. it is the single greatest threat that this country has. ",1,False
3613,TRUMP,"well, i have to say that, you know, for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. but russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do. we have not been updating from the new standpoint. i looked the other night. i was seeing b-52s, they’re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. we are not—we are not keeping up with other countries. i would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. but i would certainly not do first strike. i think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over. at the same time, we have to be prepared. i can’t take anything off the table. because you look at some of these countries, you look at north korea, we’re doing nothing there. china should solve that problem for us. china should go into north korea. china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea. and by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal i think i’ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the iran deal. iran is one of their biggest trading partners. iran has power over north korea. and when they made that horrible deal with iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to north korea. and they should have done something with respect to yemen and all these other places. and when asked to secretary kerry, why didn’t you do that? why didn’t you add other things into the deal? one of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. nobody’s ever seen that before. that turned out to be wrong. it was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, i guess for the hostages. it certainly looks that way. so you say to yourself, why didn’t they make the right deal? this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. the deal with iran will lead to nuclear problems. all they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don’t have to do much. ",1,False
3615,TRUMP,"and they’re going to end up getting nuclear. i met with bibi netanyahu the other day. believe me, he’s not a happy camper. ",1,False
3617,HILLARY CLINTON,"well, let me—let me start by saying, words matter. words matter when you run for president. and they really matter when you are president. and i want to reassure our allies in japan and south korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. it is essential that america’s word be good. and so i know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. i’ve talked with a number of them. but i want to—on behalf of myself, and i think on behalf of a majority of the american people, say that, you know, our word is good. it’s also important that we look at the entire global situation. there’s no doubt that we have other problems with iran. but personally, i’d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. and donald never tells you what he would do. would he have started a war? would he have bombed iran? if he’s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. but it’s like his plan to defeat isis. he says it’s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. so we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. people around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. can they rely on us? are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? that’s what i intend to do. i intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they’re abroad or at home. we cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with american interests and security… ",0,False

3625,TRUMP,"and it’s a big problem. and as far as japan is concerned, i want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. we cannot be the policemen of the world. we cannot protect countries all over the world… ",1,False

3629,TRUMP,"and she doesn’t say that, because she’s got no business ability. we need heart. we need a lot of things. but you have to have some basic ability. and sadly, she doesn’t have that. all of the things that she’s talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let’s say, while she had great power. but they weren’t taken care of. and if she ever wins this race, they won’t be taken care of.

3669,ROMNEY,"thank you, bob. and thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. thank you to lynn university for welcoming us here. and mr. president, it’s good to be with you again. we were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it’s nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. we’ll see what happens. this is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to america in particular, which is to see a — a complete change in the — the structure and the — the environment in the middle east. with the arab spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the middle east. but instead, we’ve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. of course we see in syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. we see in — in libya, an attack apparently by, i think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against — against our people there, four people dead. our hearts and — and minds go out to them. mali has been taken over, the northern part of mali by al-qaeda type individuals. we have in — in egypt, a muslim brotherhood president. and so what we’re seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. of course the greatest threat of all is iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. and — and we’re going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. i congratulate him on — on taking out osama bin laden and going after the leadership in al-qaeda. but we can’t kill our way out of this mess. we’re going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the — the world of islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is — it’s certainly not on the run. ",1,False
3670,ROMNEY,"it’s certainly not hiding. this is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to america, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism. ",1,False
3672,OBAMA,"well, my first job as commander in chief, bob, is to keep the american people safe. and that’s what we’ve done over the last four years. we ended the war in iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. and as a consequence, al qaeda’s core leadership has been decimated. in addition, we’re now able to transition out of afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that afghans take responsibility for their own security. and that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. now with respect to libya, as i indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, i immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those americans who were still in harm’s way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed americans and we would bring them to justice. and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. but i think it’s important to step back and think about what happened in libya. keep in mind that i and americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. got rid of a despot who had killed americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of libyans after the events in benghazi marching and saying america is our friend. we stand with them. ",0,False
3673,OBAMA,"now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. and, you know, governor romney, i’m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after al qaida, but i have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the middle east. ",0,False
3674,ROMNEY,"well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to — to kill them, to take them out of the picture. but my strategy is broader than that. that’s — that’s important, of course. but the key that we’re going to have to pursue is a — is a pathway to get the muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. we don’t want another iraq, we don’t want another afghanistan. that’s not the right course for us. the right course for us is to make sure that we go after the — the people who are leaders of these various anti-american groups and these — these jihadists, but also help the muslim world. and how do we do that? a group of arab scholars came together, organized by the u.n., to look at how we can help the — the world reject these — these terrorists. and the answer they came up with was this: one, more economic development. we should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we — we push back and give them more economic development. number two, better education. number three, gender equality. number four, the rule of law. we have to help these nations create civil societies. but what’s been happening over the last couple of years is, as we’ve watched this tumult in the middle east, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see al qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. and — and they’re throughout many nations in the middle east. ",1,False
3675,ROMNEY,"it’s wonderful that libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. but next door, of course, we have egypt. libya’s 6 million population; egypt, 80 million population. we want — we want to make sure that we’re seeing progress throughout the middle east. with mali now having north mali taken over by al qaida; with syria having assad continuing to — to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult. and, of course, iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we’ve got real (inaudible). ",1,False
3678,OBAMA,"so, what — what we need to do with respect to the middle east is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. and unfortunately, that’s the kind of opinions that you’ve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for american strength, or keeping america safe over the long haul.

3680,ROMNEY,"well, of course i don’t concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that i’ve said. they don’t happen to be accurate. but — but i can say this, that we’re talking about the middle east and how to help the middle east reject the kind of terrorism we’re seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and — and confusion. and — and attacking me is not an agenda. attacking me is not talking about how we’re going to deal with the challenges that exist in the middle east, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence. but i’ll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. first of all, russia i indicated is a geopolitical foe. not… (crosstalk) ",1,False

3702,OBAMA,"you’ve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in iraq. that is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the middle east. now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. and so what i’ve done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in israel’s security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region. number three, we do have to make sure that we’re protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can’t develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing. number four, we do have to develop their economic — their economic capabilities. but number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can’t continue to do nation building in these regions. part of american leadership is making sure that we’re doing nation building here at home. that will help us maintain the kind of american leadership that we need.

3704,OBAMA,"what we’ve done is organize the international community, saying assad has to go. we’ve mobilized sanctions against that government. we have made sure that they are isolated. we have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we’re particularly interested in making sure that we’re mobilizing the moderate forces inside of syria. but ultimately, syrians are going to have to determine their own future. and so everything we’re doing, we’re doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in syria; coordinating with turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. this — what we’re seeing taking place in syria is heartbreaking, and that’s why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. but we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we’re not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region. and i am confident that assad’s days are numbered. but what we can’t do is to simply suggest that, as governor romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term. ",0,False
3706,ROMNEY,"well, let’s step back and talk about what’s happening in syria and how important it is. first of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. secondly, syria is an opportunity for us because syria plays an important role in the middle east, particularly right now.

3707,ROMNEY,"syria is iran’s only ally in the arab world. it’s their route to the sea. it’s the route for them to arm hezbollah in lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, israel. and so seeing syria remove assad is a very high priority for us. number two, seeing a — a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. and finally, we don’t want to have military involvement there. we don’t want to get drawn into a military conflict. and so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within syria, organize them, bring them together in a — in a form of — if not government, a form of — of — of council that can take the lead in syria. and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. we do need to make sure that they don’t have arms that get into the — the wrong hands. those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. we need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with — with israel. but the saudi’s and the qatari, and — and the turks are all very concerned about this. they’re willing to work with us. we need to have a very effective leadership effort in syria, making sure that the — the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. recognize — i believe that assad must go. i believe he will go. but i believe — we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see syria as a — as a friend, and syria as a responsible party in the middle east. this — this is a critical opportunity for america. and what i’m afraid of is we’ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we’ll let the u.n. deal with it. and assad — excuse me, kofi annan came in and said we’re going to try to have a ceasefire. that didn’t work. then it went to the russians and said, let’s see if you can do something. we should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military. ",1,False
3709,ROMNEY,…by the leadership role. ,1,False
3710,OBAMA,"we are playing the leadership role. we organized the friends of syria. we are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition. and we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. but going back to libya — because this is an example of how we make choices. when we went in to libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. we also had to make sure that moammar gadhafi didn’t stay there. and to the governor’s credit, you supported us going into libya and the coalition that we organized. but when it came time to making sure that gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. imagine if we had pulled out at that point. you know, moammar gadhafi had more american blood on his hands than any individual other than osama bin laden. and so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. that’s part of the reason why the libyans stand with us. but we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to syria. that’s exactly what we’re doing. ",0,False
3712,ROMNEY,"i don’t want to have our military involved in syria. i don’t think there is a necessity to put our military in syria at this stage. i don’t anticipate that in the future. as i indicated, our objectives are to replace assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible. and i want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove — to remove assad. but i do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our — of our troops. ",1,False
3714,ROMNEY,"and this isn’t — this isn’t going to be necessary. we — we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. but look, this has been going on for a year. this is a time — this should have been a time for american leadership. we should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties. as you hear from intelligence sources even today, the — the insurgents are highly disparate. they haven’t come together. they haven’t formed a unity group, a council of some kind. that needs to happen. america can help that happen. and we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of assad. ",1,False
3716,OBAMA,"well, i’ll — i’ll be very quick. what you just heard governor romney said is he doesn’t have different ideas. and that’s because we’re doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate syrian leadership and a — an effective transition so that we get assad out. that’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown. that’s the kind of leadership we’ll continue to show.

3752,ROMNEY,"well, let’s come back and talk about the military, but all the way — all the way through. first of all, i’m going through from the very beginning — we’re going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military. that’s number one. ",1,False
3755,OBAMA,he should have answered the first question. ,0,False
3757,ROMNEY,"i’m pleased that i’ve balanced budgets. i was on the world of business for 25 years. if you didn’t balance your budget, you went out of business. i went into the olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there. i had the chance to be governor of a state. four years in a row, democrats and republicans came together to balance the budget. we cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget. the president hasn’t balanced a budget yet. i expect to have the opportunity to do so myself. ",1,False
3759,ROMNEY,"i’m going to be able to balance the budget. let’s talk about military spending, and that’s this. (crosstalk) ",1,False
3761,ROMNEY,"our navy is old — excuse me, our navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. the navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. we’re now at under 285. we’re headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. that’s unacceptable to me. i want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our navy. our air force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947. we’ve changed for the first time since fdr — since fdr we had the — we’ve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. now we’re changing to one conflict. look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the president of the united states, which is to maintain the safety of the american people. and i will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. that, in my view, is making — is making our future less certain and less secure. ",1,False
3762,OBAMA,"bob, i just need to comment on this. first of all, the sequester is not something that i’ve proposed. it is something that congress has proposed. it will not happen. the budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. it is maintaining it. but i think governor romney maybe hasn’t spent enough time looking at how our military works. you mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military’s changed. we have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. we have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. ",0,False
3763,OBAMA,"and so the question is not a game of battleship, where we’re counting slips. it’s what are our capabilities. and so when i sit down with the secretary of the navy and the joint chiefs of staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home. ",0,False
3764,OBAMA,and that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you’re putting forward because it just doesn’t work. ,0,False
3766,OBAMA,"and, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn’t work. ",0,False
3768,OBAMA,"first of all, israel is a true friend. it is our greatest ally in the region. and if israel is attacked, america will stand with israel. i’ve made that clear throughout my presidency. and… ",0,False
3770,OBAMA,"i will stand with israel if they are attacked. and this is the reason why, working with israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. in fact, this week we’ll be carrying out the largest military exercise with israel in history, this very week. but to the issue of iran, as long as i’m president of the united states iran will not get a nuclear weapon. i made that clear when i came into office. ",0,False
3773,ROMNEY,"well, first of all, i want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if i’m president of the united states, when i’m president of the united states, we will stand with israel. and if israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. that’s number one. number two, with regards to iran and the threat of iran, there’s no question but that a nuclear iran, a nuclear-capable iran is unacceptable to america. it presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. ",1,False
3776,OBAMA,"well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper. they are not true. but our goal is to get iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the u.n. resolutions that have been in place. because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. there — there are people in iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. and we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we’ll accept is they end their nuclear program. it’s very straightforward. and i’m glad that governor romney agrees with the steps that we’re taking. you know, there have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you’d do the same things we did, but you’d say them louder and somehow that — that would make a difference. and it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. it’s meticulous. we started from the day we got into office. and the reason is was so important — and this is a testament to how we’ve restored american credibility and strength around the world — is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like russia and china. because if it’s just us that are imposing sanctions — we’ve had sanctions in place a long time. it’s because we got everybody to agree that iran is seeing so much pressure. and we’ve got to maintain that pressure. there is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. there are inspections that are very intrusive. but over time, what they can do is regain credibility. in the meantime, though, we’re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. and one last thing — just — just to make this point. the clock is ticking. we’re not going to allow iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. and i’ve been very clear to them. you know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. and that clock is ticking. and we’re going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don’t have a nuclear weapon. ",0,False
3780,ROMNEY,"we’re four years closer to a nuclear iran. we’re four years closer to a nuclear iran. and — and — we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they — they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. that’s number one. number two, mr. president, the reason i call it an apology tour is because you went to the middle east and you flew to egypt and to saudi arabia and to turkey and iraq. and by the way, you skipped israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations. and by the way, they noticed that you skipped israel. and then in those nations, and on arabic tv, you said that america had been dismissive and derisive. you said that on occasion america had dictated to other nations. mr. president, america has not dictated to other nations. we have freed other nations from dictators. ",1,False
3781,OBAMA,"bob, let me — let me respond. if we’re going to talk about trips that we’ve taken — when i was a candidate for office, first trip i took was to visit our troops. and when i went to israel as a candidate, i didn’t take donors. i didn’t attend fundraisers. i went to yad beshef (ph), the holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with israel will be unbreakable. and then i went down to the border towns of storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from hamas. and i saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children’s bedrooms. and i was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. which is why as president, we funded an iron dome program to stop those missiles. ",0,False
3782,OBAMA,"so that’s how i’ve used my travels, when i travel to israel and when i travel to the region. and the — the central question at this point is going to be: who is going to be credible to all parties involved? and they can look at my track record, whether it’s iran sanctions, whether it’s dealing with counterterrorism, whether it’s supporting democracy, whether it’s supporting women’s rights, whether it’s supporting religious minorities. and they can say that the president of the united states and the united states of america has stood on the right side of history. and that kind of credibility is precisely why we’ve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now. ",0,False
3784,ROMNEY,"bob, let’s not go into hypotheticals of that nature. our relationship with israel, my relationship with the prime minister of israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way. this is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of — (crosstalk) ",1,False
3788,ROMNEY,"i look around the world, i don’t see our influence growing around the world. i see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way i think it ought to be; in part because of the — the — the turmoil with israel. i mean, the president received a letter from 38 democrat senators saying the tensions with israel were a real problem. they asked him, please repair the tension — democrat senators — please repair the tension… ",1,False
3790,ROMNEY,… the damage in his — in his own party. ,1,False
3791,OBAMA,"governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it’s the middle east, whether it’s afghanistan, whether it’s iraq, whether it’s now iran, you’ve been all over the map. i mean, i’m — i’m pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the iranians to end their nuclear program. but just a few years ago you said that’s something you’d never do. in the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in afghanistan, now you’re for it, although it depends. in the same way that you say you would have ended the war in iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. the same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after gadhafi. when it comes to going after osama bin laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. but when you were a candidate in 2008, as i was, and i said if i got bin laden in our sights i would take that shot, you said we shouldn’t move heaven and earth to get one man. ",0,False
3792,OBAMA,"and you said we should ask pakistan for permission. and if we had asked pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. and it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. you know, after we killed bin laden i was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened. and the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying “peyton (ph), i love you and i will always watch over you.” and for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. and she said to me, “you know, by finally getting bin laden, that brought some closure to me.” and when we do things like that — when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. and i make that point because that’s the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. those decisions generally — generally are not poll-tested. and even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did. but what the american people understand is that i look at what we need to get done to keep the american people safe and to move our interests forward, and i make those decisions. ",0,False
3794,ROMNEY,bob… ,1,False
3796,ROMNEY,you can’t — but you can’t have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond. ,1,False
3798,ROMNEY,"well, that’s probably true. ",1,False
3801,ROMNEY,"so for me, i look at this as both a need to help move pakistan in the right direction, and also to get afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014. ",1,False
3806,ROMNEY,"no, it’s not time to divorce a nation on earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as i indicated before, the taliban, haqqani network. it’s a nation that’s not like — like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. you have the isi, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the — of three branches there. then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. this is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it — if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you’ve got — you’ve got terrorists there who could grab their — their hands onto those nuclear weapons. ",1,False
3807,ROMNEY,"this is — this is an important part of the world for us. pakistan is — is technically an ally, and they’re not acting very much like an ally right now. but we have some work to do. and i — i don’t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with pakistan is strained. we — we had to go into pakistan. we had to go in there to get osama bin laden. that was the right thing to do. and — and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. but we’re going to have to work with the — with the people in pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they’re on. and it’s important for them. it’s important for the nuclear weapons. it’s important for the success of afghanistan. because inside pakistan, you have a — a large group of pashtun that are — that are taliban. they’re going to come rushing back in to afghanistan when we go. and that’s one of the reasons the afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. but it’s important for us to recognize that we can’t just walk away from pakistan. but we do need to make sure that as we — as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on — on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society. ",1,False
3809,ROMNEY,"well i believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. and it’s widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and i support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. but let me also note that as i said earlier, we’re going to have to do more than just going after leaders and — and killing bad guys, important as that is. ",1,False
3810,ROMNEY,"we’re also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and islamic extremism. we haven’t done that yet. we talk a lot about these things, but you look at the — the record, you look at the record. you look at the record of the last four years and say is iran closer to a bomb? yes. is the middle east in tumult? yes. is — is al-qaida on the run, on its heels? no. is — are israel and the palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? no, they haven’t had talks in two years. we have not seen the progress we need to have, and i’m convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands. ",1,False
3811,OBAMA,"well, keep in mind our strategy wasn’t just going after bin laden. we created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in somalia, in yemen, in pakistan. and what we’ve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people’s lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren’t corrupt, to make sure that they’re treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they’ve got a free market system that works. so across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. and we have stood on the side of democracy. one thing i think americans should be proud of, when tunisians began to protest, this nation — me, my administration — stood with them earlier than just about any country. in egypt we stood on the side of democracy. in libya we stood on the side of the people. and as a consequence, there’s no doubt that attitudes about americans have changed. but there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the united states. and we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that. ",0,False
3812,OBAMA,"but we’re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. the truth, though, is that al qaeda is much weaker than it was when i came into office. and they don’t have the same capacities to attack the u.s. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.

REAGAN,"our policy was not to cut subsidies. we have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the federal government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. and this is what we’ve been trying to do, is involve the federal government in such partnerships. we are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we’re going to continue along that line. we have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. we have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. the safety net is there, and we’re taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.

3892,MR. REAGAN,"well, i was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since i was a small boy. in our particular church, we did not use that term, “born again,” so i don’t know whether i would fit that — that particular term. but i have — thanks to my mother, god rest her soul — the firmest possible belief and faith in god. and i don’t believe — i believe, i should say, as lincoln once said, that i could not — i would be the most stupid man in the world if i thought i could confront the duties of the office i hold if i could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. and i do resort to prayer. at the same time, however, i have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign — or religion a part of that campaign. as a matter of fact, i think religion became a part of this campaign when mr. mondale’s running mate said i wasn’t a good christian. so, it does play a part in my life. i have no hesitancy in saying so. and, as i say, i don’t believe that i could carry on unless i had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered. ",1,False
3894,MR. REAGAN,"the answer to your question is very simple about why i don’t go to church. i have gone to church regularly all my life, and i started to here in washington. and now, in the position i hold and in the world in which we live, where embassies do get blown up in beirut — we’re supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, i understand — but i pose a threat to several hundred people if i go to church. i know the threats that are made against me. we all know the possibility of terrorism. we have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the white house. and, therefore, i don’t feel — and my minister knows this and supports me in this position — i don’t feel that i have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in beirut, for example. and i miss going to church, but i think the lord understands.

3897,MR. MONDALE,"first of all, i accept president reagan’s affirmation of faith. i’m sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. i am a son of a methodist minister. my wife is the daughter of a presbyterian minister. and i don’t know if i’ve been born again, but i know i was born into a christian family. and i believe i have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the presidency. whether that helps or not, i don’t know. i have a deep religious faith. our family does. it is fundamental. it’s probably the reason that i’m in politics. i think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. and i think we’re all together on that. what bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one’s own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others’ faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. all history tells us that that’s a mistake. when the republican platform says that from here on out, we’re going to have a religious test for judges before they’re selected for the federal court, and then jerry falwell announces that that means they get at least two justices of the supreme court, i think that’s an abuse of faith in our country. this nation is the most religious nation on earth — more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on earth — and it’s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. that’s why faith in the united states is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. and i think if we want to continue — as i do — to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it. ",0,False
3906,MR. REAGAN,"yes, it’s very difficult to rebut, because i find myself in so much agreement with mr. mondale. i, too, want that wall that is in the constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. the only attacks i have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. and they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. a child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can’t do it because it’s school property. these are they types of things that i think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and i am opposed to that. with regard to a platform on the supreme court, i can only say one thing about that. i have appointed one member to the supreme court: sandra day o’connor. i’ll stand on my record on that. and if i have the opportunity to appoint any more, i’ll do it in the same manner that i did in selecting her. ",1,False
3908,MR. MONDALE,"the platform to which the president refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. and jerry falwell says that means we get two or three judges. and it would involve a religious test for the first time in american life. let’s take the example that the president cites. i believe in prayer. my family prays. we’ve never had any difficulty finding time to pray. but do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the president that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? who would write the prayer? what would it say? how would it be resolved when those disputes occur? it seems to me that a moment’s reflection tells you why the united states senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. we don’t want that.

3917,MR. REAGAN,"there are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you’ve named some of them. crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down — or since we’ve kept records — 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we’ve had. i think that we’ve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. the environment? yes, i feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. when we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program — but it’s just about finished already — a billion dollars. and now we’re going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. we have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges. i think that we’re out in front of most — and i see that the red light is blinking, so i can’t continue. but i’ve got more.

3921,MR. REAGAN,"before i campaigned as a democrat for a republican candidate for president, i had already voted for dwight eisenhower to be president of the united states. and so, my change had come earlier than that. i hadn’t gotten around to reregistering as yet. i found that was rather difficult to do. but i finally did it. there are some other things that have been said here — back, and you said that i might be able to dredge them up. mr. mondale referred to the farmers’ worst year. the farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. the farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the carter-mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. all of these things are presently being rectified, and i think that we are going to salvage the farmers. as a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have. ",1,False
3926,MR. REAGAN,"the laws regarding that always were state laws. it was only when the supreme court handed down a decision that the federal government intervened in what had always been a state policy. our laws against murder are state laws. so, i would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this. as i say, i feel that we have a problem here to resolve. and no one has approached it from that matter. it does not happen that the church that i belong to had that as part of its dogma. i know that some churches do. now, it is a sin if you’re taking a human life. at the same time, in our judeo-christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. and therefore, i’ve always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own. ",1,False
3930,MR. MONDALE,"the basic decision of the supreme court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that’s the way it’s been done. and it’s a personal and private, moral judgment. i don’t know the answer to when life begins. and it’s not that simple, either. you’ve got another life involved. and if it’s rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? if it’s incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? does every woman in america have to present herself before some judge picked by jerry falwell to clear her personal judgment? it won’t work.

3932,MR. REAGAN,"yes. well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn’t that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that? now, i’m not capable, and i don’t think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. i am simply saying that i believe that that’s where the effort should be directed — to make that determination. i don’t think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. that, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we’re talking about a life. but in this great society of ours, wouldn’t it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? there are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can’t have them any other way. ",1,False
3934,MR. MONDALE,"i agree with that, and that’s why i was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. i’m all for that. but the question is whether this other option proposed by the president should be pursued. and i don’t agree with it. since i’ve got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. the question of agriculture came up a minute ago. net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. and the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. it’s been a big failure. i opposed the grain embargo in my administration. i’m opposed to these policies as well.

3943,MR. REAGAN,"yes, i had used — “last resort” would always be with me. if you got the government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then i had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted. i don’t foresee those things happening, so i say with great confidence i’m not going to go for a tax. with regard to assailing mr. bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, i think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there — had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. all of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.

3958,MR. REAGAN,"well, some of those facts and figures just don’t stand up. yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. it has begun to decline, but it is still going up. on the other hand, women heads of household — single women heads of household have — for the first time there’s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. we have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. it had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. we are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. we’re spending a third more on all of the — well, all of the programs of human service. we have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before — 2,300,000 more are receiving them — even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. we found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. we have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. some time ago, mr. mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. half — one out of two of the full-time college students in the united states are receiving some form of federal aid. but there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. we didn’t think that was right. and so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. so, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings — 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.

4353,DOLE,"well, i would say first of all, i think, it’s a very good question. i appreciate the quote from the young man. there’s no doubt about it that many american people have lost their faith in government. they see scandals almost on a daily basis. they see ethical problems in the whitehouse today. they see 900 fbi files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the whitehouse. nobody knows who hired this man. so there’s a great deal of cynicism out there. but i’ve always tried in whatever i’ve done is to bring people together. i said in my acceptance speech in san diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked. if you think the republican party is some place for you to come if you’re narrow minded or bigoted or don’t like certain people in america, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as i stand here without compromise, because this is the party of lincoln. i think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials. i’m no longer a public official. i left public life on june the 11th of this year. but it is very important. young people are looking to us. they’re looking to us for leadership. they’re watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver. and i would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here. when i’m president of the united states, i will keep my word. my word is my bond.

But I think that it’s important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there. There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter. The US should try to work with its allies and stop it. I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did–and I applaud that. I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he’s going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it. I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing. We can’t get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can. END Part 1, 1992 Debate 1 END Part 1, 1992 Debate 1       ",0,False

4542,MR. KENNEDY,"mr. mcgee, we have a contractual right to be in berlin coming out of the conversations at potsdam and of world war ii. that has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the united states; it’s been reinforced by a number of other nations under nato. i’ve stated on many occasions that the united states must meet its commitment on berlin. it is a commitment that we have to meet if we’re going to protect the security of western europe. and therefore on this question i don’t think that there is any doubt in the mind of any american; i hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of west berlin; i’m sure there isn’t any doubt in the mind of the russians. we will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of west berlin. ",0,False
4544,MR. NIXON,"yes. as a matter of fact, the statement that senator kennedy made was that – to the effect that there were trigger-happy republicans, that my stand on quemoy and matsu was an indication of trigger-happy republicans. i resent that comment. i resent it because th- it’s an implication that republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. i would remind senator kennedy of the past fifty years. i would ask him to name one republican president who led this nation into war. there were three democratic presidents who led us into war. i do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. but i do say that any statement to the effect that the republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. we had a war when we came into power in 1953. we got rid of that; we’ve kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn’t indicate that we’re trigger-happy. we’ve been strong, but we haven’t been trigger-happy. as far as berlin is concerned, there isn’t any question about the necessity of defending berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn’t any question about what the united american people – republicans and democrats alike – would do in the event there were an attempt by the communists to take over berlin. ",1,False
4547,MR. NIXON,"mr. von fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack. i will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on formosa – which would be the indication today because the chinese communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking formosa – in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on formosa, there isn’t any question but that the united states would then again, as in the case of berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of formosa. but to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the united states. i will only say this, however, in addition: to do what senator kennedy has suggested – to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our chinese nationalist allies to surrender them in advance – is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. this is the history of dealing with dictators. this is something that senator kennedy and all americans must know. we tried this with hitler. it didn’t work. he wanted first uh – we know, austria, and then he went on to the sudetenland and then danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. now what do the chinese communists want? they don’t want just quemoy and matsu; they don’t want just formosa; they want the world. and the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you’re not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that’s going to satisfy them, it doesn’t satisfy them. it only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? i’ve often heard president eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? and i say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory – this or any others – in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.

4551,MR. KENNEDY,"well i think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in january, february, and march of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces. then i believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on minuteman and on polaris. it may be a long period, but we must – we must get started immediately. now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, i must say that i feel that another effort should be made by a new administration in january of 1961, to renew negotiations with the soviet union and see whether it’s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. there are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity – including red china – by the end of the presidential office in 1964. this is extremely serious. there have been many wars in the history of mankind. and to take a chance uh – now be – and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, i think would be a great mistake. one of my disagreements with the present administration has been that i don’t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and i believe it’s been reflected in our success and failures at geneva. now, we may not succeed. the soviet union may not agree to an inspection system. we may be able to get satisfactory assurances. it may be necessary for us to begin testing again. but i hope the next administration – and if i have anything to do with it, the next administration will – make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. these must be done. if we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. but i would make the effort because i think the fate not only of our own civilization, but i think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war. ",0,False
4553,MR. NIXON,"yes. i am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and i will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. there isn’t any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let’s have in mind this: when senator kennedy suggests that we haven’t been making an effort, he simply doesn’t know what he’s talking about. it isn’t a question of the number of people who are working in an administration. it’s a question of who they are. this has been one of the highest level operations in the whole state department right under the president himself. we have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the soviet union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. and i just want to make one thing very clear. yes, we should make a great effort. but under no circumstances must the united states ever make an agreement based on trust. there must be an absolute guarantee. now, just a comment on senator kennedy’s last answer. he forgets that in this same debate on the formosa resolution, which he said he voted for – which he did – that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment – and on this particular – or for an amendment, i should say – which passed the senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. and that amendment put the senate of the united states on record with a majority of the senator’s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of republicans – put them on record – against the very position that the senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the united states will not defend the offshore islands.

4561,MR.

",0,False
4563,MR. NIXON,"yes, i think so. of course, both er – senator kennedy and i have felt mr. truman’s ire; and uh – consequently, i think he can speak with some feeling on this subject. i just do want to say one thing, however. we all have tempers; i have one; i’m sure senator kennedy has one. but when a man’s president of the united states, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public. one thing i’ve noted as i’ve traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates. i see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the united states. i know senator kennedy sees them, too. it makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of america will either look up to, or will look down to. and i can only say that i’m very proud that president eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the united states. and i only hope that, should i win this election, that i could approach president eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the white house and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: “well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that i would want my child to follow.” ",1,False
4565,MR. NIXON,"well, mr. cater, of course it’s a criticism that uh – is being made. uh – i obviously don’t think it’s valid. i have supported the administration’s position and i think that that position has been correct; i think my position has been correct. as far as indochina was concerned, i stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the united states make it clear that we would not tolerate indochina falling under communist domination. now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of indochina, the communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. now, looking to the u-2 flights, i would like to point out that i have been supporting the president’s position throughout. i think the president was correct in ordering these flights. i think the president was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. i noted, for example, in reading a – uh – a – a particular discussion that senator kennedy had with dave garroway shortly after the uh – his statement about regrets, that uh – he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh – were ones that shouldn’t have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would mr. khrushchev had felt if we had uh – had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if mr. khrushchev ha – uh – had a flight over the united states while uh – he was visiting here. and the answer, of course, is that communist espionage goes on all the time. the answer is that the united states can’t afford to have a es- an es – a espionage lack or should we s- uh – lag – or should i say uh – an intelligence lag – any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. now, referring to your question with regard to quemoy and matsu. what i object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. senator kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote – a uh – vote which i’ve referred to several times – where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. now, why did they reject it? for the very reason that those senators knew, as the president of the united states knew, that you should not indicate to the communists in advance that you’re going to surrender an area that’s free. why? because they know as senator kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression. ",1,False
4567,MR. KENNEDY,"well number one on indochina, mr. nixon talked in – before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and i quote him, “american boys into indochina.” the reason indochina was preserved was the result of the geneva conference which indochina. number two, on the question of the u-2 flights. i thought the. u-2 flight in may just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. i never criticized the u-2 flights in general, however. i never suggested espionage should stop. it still goes on, i would assume, on both sides. number three, the vice president – on may fifteenth after the u-2 flight – indicated that the flights were going on, even though the administration and the president had canceled the flights on may twelfth. number three, the pre – vice president suggests that we should keep the communists in doubt about whether we would fight on quemoy and matsu. that’s not the position he’s taking. he’s indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. he didn’t take that position on tibet. he didn’t take that position on budapest. he doesn’t take that position that i’ve seen so far in laos. guinea and ghana have both moved within the soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has cuba. i merely say that the united states should meet its commitments to que- to uh – formosa and the pescadores. but as admiral yarnell has said, and he’s been supported by most military authority, these islands that we’re now talking about are not worth the bones of a single american soldier; and i know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. and therefore, i think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between mr. nixon and myself. he’s extending the administration’s commitment.

4570,MR. KENNEDY,"well the que- the – mr. griffin, i believe, who is the head of the klan, who lives in tampa, florida, indicated a – in a statement, i think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for mr. nixon. i do not suggest in any way, nor have i ever, that that indicates that mr. nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the ku klux klan. that’s absurd. i don’t suggest that, i don’t support it. i would disagree with it. mr. nixon knows very well that in this – in this whole matter that’s been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, i’ve never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it. and that’s my view now. i disapprove of the issue. i do not suggest that mr. nixon does in any way. ",0,False
4576,MR. KENNEDY,"well, i always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they’re stated by the vice president. i never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. i’m opposed to that, was opposed to it in october, 1958. i have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the taft-hartley act. i don’t know what other weapons the vice president is talking about. i’m talking about giving him four or five tools – not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations – recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. one of the additional powers that i would suggest would be seizure. there might be others. by the president having five powers – four or five powers – and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. the difficulty now is the president’s course is quite limited. he can set up a fact-finding committee. the fact-finding committee’s powers are limited. he can provide an injunction if there’s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the congress. this is a difficult and sensitive matter. but to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. he could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now – the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn’t happen.

4592,MR. NIXON,"well, mr. von fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the american dollar. that means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. and here we have a very strong program going forward in the department of commerce. this one must be stepped up. beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh – we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. now america has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. i think we have been right in carrying it. i have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. but now we find that the countries of europe for example, that we have aided, and japan, that we’ve aided in the far east; these countries – some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. they have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. that’s why i am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next administration – if, of course, i get the opportunity – a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for africa, asia and latin america. the united states cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. we can a big share of it, but we’ve got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, i think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about. ",1,False
4594,MR. KENNEDY,"just to uh – correct the record, mr. nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine. what i said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren’t loopholes. if his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn’t want to go into it. now on the question of gold. the difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. in other words, if we’re going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. we have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. we have to be able to compete in the world market. we have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh – from abroad if we’re going to be able to meet our obligations. in addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage. now there isn’t a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. i believe that we must be able to compete in the market – steel and in all the basic commodities abroad – we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. we have to be sure to maintain that. we have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we’ve maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in africa, latin america and asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.

CARTER,"well, mr. ford acts like he’s uh – running for president for the first time. he’s been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new salt agreement. he has learned the date of the expiration of salt i, apparently. we’ve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. as a nuclear engineer myself, i know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. i also – know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. only the last few days with the election approaching, has mr. ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. i advocated last may in a speech at the united nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. i’ve also advocated that we stop the sale by germany and france of – processing plants for pakistan and brazil. mr. ford hasn’t moved on this. we also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. mr. ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh – government uh – plants. this kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. we now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. if we continue under mr. ford’s policy by 1985 or ’90 we’ll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. this has got to be stopped. that is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that i will assume as the next president.

5100,MR. FORD,"i believe that uh – our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality. and the initiatives that we took in southern africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. if the united states had not moved when we did in southern africa, there’s no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. if we had not taken our initiative, it’s very, very possible that uh – the government of rhodesia would have been overrun and that the soviet union and the cubans would have dominated uh – southern africa. so the united states, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh – i believe followed the good conscience of the american people in foreign policy. and i believe that we used our skill. secretary of state kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black african nations, the so-called front-line nations. he has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of south africa, mr. vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of rhodesia. secretary kissinger, in his meeting with uh – prime minister smith of rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. this is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the united states, under this administration, has taken. and i can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the middle east where it is vitally important because the middle east is the crossroads of the world. there’ve been more disputes in its area where there’s more volatility than any other place in the world. but because arab nations and the israelis trust the united states, we were able to take the lead in the sinai ii agreement. and i can assure you that the united states will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the middle eastern problems, i hope and trust as soon as possible. and we will do it with the highest moral principles.

5102,MR. FORD,"i would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another – and the united states must not spread itself too thinly – that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in vietnam – but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the united states will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences. let me take uh – south korea as an example. i have personally told president pack that the united states does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country. but i think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that south korea has. on the north they have north korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops – they are supported by the people’s republic of china; they are supported by the soviet union. south korea faces a very delicate situation. now the united states, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the united states, south korea, north korea and the uh – people’s republic of china sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the korean peninsula. this is a leadership role that the united states under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and i think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in south korea at the present time.

5107,MR. CARTER,"well, here again, uh – the panamanian question is one that’s been confused by mr. ford. uh – he had directed his uh – diplomatic relation – uh – uh – representative to yield to the panamanians full sovereignty over the panama canal zone at the end of a certain period of time. when mr. reagan raised this uh – question in florida uh – mr. ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word “detente.” i would never give up complete control or practical control of the panama canal zone, but i would continue to negotiate with the panamanians. when the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when theodore roosevelt was president, panama retained sovereignty over the panama canal zone. we retained control as though we had sovereignty. now i would be willing to go ahead with negotiations. i believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the panama canal zone with panama. i would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the panama canal zone. i might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the panama canal zane, but i would not relinquish practical control of the panama canal zane any time in the foreseeable future.

5124,MR.

5126,MR. CARTER,"the purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future. this election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children. will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? will we have a world of hunger and – and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that’s been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world? will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the american people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government – our government – to depart from the principles of our constitution and bill of rights? or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future? or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don’t? can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world? i believe we can and we ought to. now we’ve been hurt in recent years in this country. in the aftermath of vietnam, cambodia, chile, pakistan, angola, watergate, cia, we’ve been hurt. our people feel that we’ve lost something precious. that’s not necessary. i wanna see our nation – return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. i remember the world with nato, and the world of point four, and the world of the marshall plan, and the world of the peace corps. why can’t we have that once again? we ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. we haven’t been lately. we can be once again. we’ll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles. it ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats. it ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that god’s given us in the greatest nation on earth – the united states.

BUSH,"no, i don’t believe it’s going to happen. i believe i’m going to win, because the american people know i know how to lead. i’ve shown the american people i know how to lead. i have — i understand everybody in this country doesn’t agree with the decisions i’ve made. and i made some tough decisions. but people know where i stand. people out there listening know what i believe. and that’s how best it is to keep the peace. this nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate. and that’s what they are. this is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in russia, that’ll attack unmercifully in iraq, hoping to shake our will. we have a duty to defeat this enemy. we have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. the best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty. and that’s what people are seeing now is happening in afghanistan. ten million citizens have registered to vote. it’s a phenomenal statistic. that if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. forty-one percent of those 10 million are women. in iraq, no doubt about it, it’s tough. it’s hard work. it’s incredibly hard. you know why? because an enemy realizes the stakes. the enemy understands a free iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. that’s why they’re fighting so vociferously. they showed up in afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn’t. and they’re showing up in iraq for the same reason. they’re trying to defeat us. and if we lose our will, we lose. but if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy. ",1,False
5348,KERRY,"i believe in being strong and resolute and determined. and i will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. but we also have to be smart, jim. and smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in afghanistan against osama bin laden and taking if off to iraq where the 9/11 commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and saddam hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of saddam hussein. this president has made, i regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. and judgment is what we look for in the president of the united states of america. i’m proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff john shalikashvili; just yesterday, general eisenhower’s son, general john eisenhower, endorsed me; general admiral william crown; general tony mcbeak, who ran the air force war so effectively for his father — all believe i would make a stronger commander in chief. and they believe it because they know i would not take my eye off of the goal: osama bin laden. unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of tora bora. we had him surrounded. but we didn’t use american forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. the president relied on afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. that’s wrong. ",0,False
5352,GEORGE W. BUSH,"my opponent looked at the same intelligence i looked at and declared in 2002 that saddam hussein was a grave threat. he also said in december of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without saddam hussein does not have the judgment to be president. i agree with him. the world is better off without saddam hussein. i was hoping diplomacy would work. i understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm’s way. it’s the hardest decision a president makes. so i went to the united nations. i didn’t need anybody to tell me to go to the united nations. i decided to go there myself. and i went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get saddam hussein to listen to our demands. they passed the resolution that said, “disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences.” i believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. saddam hussein had no intention of disarming. why should he? he had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. as a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. the facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. that wasn’t going to work. that’s kind of a pre-september 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. he was hoping we’d turn away. but there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action. we did. the world is safer without saddam hussein. ",1,False
5354,GEORGE W. BUSH,"jim, we’ve got the capability of doing both. as a matter of fact, this is a global effort. we’re facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they’ll strike anywhere, with any means. and that’s why it’s essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. that’s why it’s essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like al qaida, which we are. but to say that there’s only one focus on the war on terror doesn’t really understand the nature of the war on terror. of course we’re after saddam hussein — i mean bin laden. he’s isolated. seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice. the killer — the mastermind of the september 11th attacks, khalid sheik mohammed, is in prison. we’re making progress. but the front on this war is more than just one place. the philippines — we’ve got help — we’re helping them there to bring — to bring al qaida affiliates to justice there. and, of course, iraq is a central part in the war on terror. that’s why zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. the biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in iraq. we will succeed. we’ve got a plan to do so. and the main reason we’ll succeed is because the iraqis want to be free. i had the honor of visiting with prime minister allawi. he’s a strong, courageous leader. he believes in the freedom of the iraqi people. he doesn’t want u.s. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the iraqi people. he believes, like i believe, that the iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. they just need the help to be trained. there will be elections in january. we’re spending reconstruction money. and our alliance is strong. that’s the plan for victory. and when iraq if free, america will be more secure. ",1,False
5356,KERRY,"the president just talked about iraq as a center of the war on terror. iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. the president made the judgment to divert forces from under general tommy franks from afghanistan before the congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in iraq. and he rushed the war in iraq without a plan to win the peace. now, that is not the judgment that a president of the united states ought to make. you don’t take america to war unless have the plan to win the peace. you don’t send troops to war without the body armor that they need. i’ve met kids in ohio, parents in wisconsin places, iowa, where they’re going out on the internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids. some of them got it for a birthday present. i think that’s wrong. humvees — 10,000 out of 12,000 humvees that are over there aren’t armored. and you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don’t have the armament. this president just — i don’t know if he sees what’s really happened over there. but it’s getting worse by the day. more soldiers killed in june than before. more in july than june. more in august than july. more in september than in august. and now we see beheadings. and we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they’re blowing people up. and we don’t have enough troops there.

5359,GEORGE W. BUSH,"thank you, sir. first of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it’s the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. i don’t see how you can lead this country to succeed in iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place. what message does that send our troops? what message does that send to our allies? what message does that send the iraqis? no, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that i’ve just outlined. ",1,False
5361,KERRY,"yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and i am. and i will succeed for those troops, now that we’re there. we have to succeed. we can’t leave a failed iraq. but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of osama bin laden. it was. now, we can succeed. but i don’t believe this president can. i think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what’s necessary to make it so america isn’t doing this alone. ",0,False
5363,KERRY,"jim, let me tell you exactly what i’ll do. and there are a long list of thing. first of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to iraq to put police officers in the streets of iraq, and the president is cutting the cops program in america? what kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in iraq, but we’re shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in america. the president hasn’t put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. that’s why they had to close down the subway in new york when the republican convention was there. we hadn’t done the work that ought to be done. the president — 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in florida, are not inspected. civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is x-rayed, but the cargo hold is not x- rayed. does that make you feel safer in america? this president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in america a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. those aren’t my values. i believe in protecting america first. and long before president bush and i get a tax cut — and that’s who gets it — long before we do, i’m going to invest in homeland security and i’m going to make sure we’re not cutting cops programs in america and we’re fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. the president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn’t want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. and there’s an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. that’s a whole other subject, but i see we still have a little bit more time. let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the soviet union — former soviet union for 13 years. i’m going to do it in four years. and we’re going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists. ",0,False
5365,GEORGE W. BUSH,"i don’t think we want to get to how he’s going to pay for all these promises. it’s like a huge tax gap. anyway, that’s for another debate. my administration has tripled the amount of money we’re spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year. my administration worked with the congress to create the department of homeland security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. we’ve got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border. we’re modernizing our borders. we spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion. we’re doing our duty to provide the funding. but the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. you know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time. and the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. there’s a lot of good people working hard. and by the way, we’ve also changed the culture of the fbi to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. we’re communicating better. we’re going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. the patriot act is vital — is vital that the congress renew the patriot act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells. but again, i repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense. ",1,False
5367,KERRY,"the president just said the fbi had changed its culture. we just read on the front pages of america’s papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to. on one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time. and the test is not whether you’re spending more money. the test is, are you doing everything possible to make america safe? we didn’t need that tax cut. america needed to be safe. ",0,False
5368,GEORGE W. BUSH,"of course we’re doing everything we can to protect america. i wake up every day thinking about how best to protect america. that’s my job. i work with director mueller of the fbi; comes in my office when i’m in washington every morning, talking about how to protect us. there’s a lot of really good people working hard to do so. it’s hard work. but, again, i want to tell the american people, we’re doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again. ",1,False
5370,GEORGE W. BUSH,"let me first tell you that the best way for iraq to be safe and secure is for iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. and that’s what we’re doing. we’ve got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year. that is the best way. we’ll never succeed in iraq if the iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. i believe they want to. prime minister allawi believes they want to. and so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home — which i really want to do, but i don’t want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; i want to do so because we’ve achieved an objective — is to see the iraqis perform and to see the iraqis step up and take responsibility. and so, the answer to your question is: when our general is on the ground and ambassador negroponte tells me that iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they’re on their way to, you know, a nation that’s free; that’s when. and i hope it’s as soon as possible. but i know putting artificial deadlines won’t work. my opponent at one time said, “well, get me elected, i’ll have them out of there in six months.” you can’t do that and expect to win the war on terror. my message to our troops is, “thank you for what you’re doing. we’re standing with you strong. we’ll give you all the equipment you need. and we’ll get you home as soon as the mission’s done, because this is a vital mission.” a free iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that’s essential. a free iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. a free iraq will help secure israel. a free iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like iran. a free iraq is essential for the security of this country.

5377,GEORGE W. BUSH,"my opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm’s way, “wrong war, wrong place, wrong time”? not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a “great diversion.” as well, help is on the way, but it’s certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it. not what a commander in chief does when you’re trying to lead troops. ",1,False
5379,KERRY,"well, you know, when i talked about the $87 billion, i made a mistake in how i talk about the war. but the president made a mistake in invading iraq. which is worse? i believe that when you know something’s going wrong, you make it right. that’s what i learned in vietnam. when i came back from that war i saw that it was wrong. some people don’t like the fact that i stood up to say no, but i did. and that’s what i did with that vote. and i’m going to lead those troops to victory. ",0,False
5381,KERRY,"no, and they don’t have to, providing we have the leadership that we put — that i’m offering. i believe that we have to win this. the president and i have always agreed on that. and from the beginning, i did vote to give the authority, because i thought saddam hussein was a threat, and i did accept that intelligence. but i also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. then the president, in fact, promised them. he went to cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, “we will plan carefully. we will proceed cautiously. we will not make war inevitable. we will go with our allies.” he didn’t do any of those things. they didn’t do the planning. they left the planning of the state department in the state department desks. they avoided even the advice of their own general. general shinsheki, the army chief of staff, said you’re going to need several hundred thousand troops. instead of listening to him, they retired him. the terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since ronald reagan, said, “invading iraq in response to 9/11 would be like franklin roosevelt invading mexico in response to pearl harbor.” that’s what we have here. and what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. they do have stakes in it. they’ve always had stakes in it. the arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. the european countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. but this president hasn’t even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. in fact, he’s done the opposite. he pushed them away. when the secretary general kofi annan offered the united nations, he said, “no, no, we’ll go do this alone.” to save for halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the defense department saying, “if you weren’t with us in the war, don’t bother applying for any construction.” that’s not a way to invite people. ",0,False
5383,GEORGE W. BUSH,"that’s totally absurd. of course, the u.n. was invited in. and we support the u.n. efforts there. they pulled out after sergio de mello got killed. but they’re now back in helping with elections. my opponent says we didn’t have any allies in this war. what’s he say to tony blair? what’s he say to alexander kwasniewski of poland? you can’t expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with american troops in iraq. plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in iraq is to call upon nations to serve. so what’s the message going to be: “please join us in iraq. for a grand diversion. join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?” i know how these people think. i deal with them all the time. i sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently. they’re not going to follow somebody who says, “this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.” they’re not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. they’re not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in america. and finally, he says we ought to have a summit. well, there are summits being held. japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged. and prime minister koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute. and there’s going to be an arab summit, of the neighborhood countries. and colin powell helped set up that summit.

5387,GEORGE W.

5389,GEORGE W. BUSH,"no, what i said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the saddam loyalists were around. i mean, we thought we’d whip more of them going in. but because tommy franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the baathists and saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. i thought they would stay and fight, but they didn’t. and now we’re fighting them now. and it’s hard work. i understand how hard it is. i get the casualty reports every day. i see on the tv screens how hard it is. but it’s necessary work. and i’m optimistic. see, i think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. i’m optimistic we’ll achieve — i know we won’t achieve if we send mixed signals. i know we’re not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the iraqi citizens. we’ve got a plan in place. the plan says there will be elections in january, and there will be. the plan says we’ll train iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are. and it’s not only just america, but nato is now helping, jordan’s helping train police, uae is helping train police. we’ve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts. and we’re making progress there. and our alliance is strong. and as i just told you, there’s going to be a summit of the arab nations. japan will be hosting a summit. we’re making progress. it is hard work. it is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy. it’s hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free. but it’s necessary work. and a free iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.

5416,GEORGE W.

5418,GEORGE W.

5430,GEORGE W. BUSH,"north korea, first, i do. let me say — i certainly hope so. before i was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with north korea. and we signed an agreement with north korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the north koreans. and so i decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. and in crawford, texas, jiang zemin and i agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, korean peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world’s interest. and so we began a new dialogue with north korea, one that included not only the united states, but now china. and china’s a got a lot of influence over north korea, some ways more than we do. as well, we included south korea, japan and russia. so now there are five voices speaking to kim jong il, not just one. and so if kim jong il decides again to not honor an agreement, he’s not only doing injustice to america, he’d be doing injustice to china, as well. and i think this will work. it’s not going to work if we open up a dialogue with kim jong il. thatâ€™s what he wants. he wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that’s sending him a clear message. on iran, i hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. we worked very closely with the foreign ministers of france, germany and great britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. the iaea is involved. there’s a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. i hope we can do it. and we’ve got a good strategy.

5432,KERRY,"with respect to iran, the british, french, and germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the united states, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in iran. i believe we could have done better. i think the united states should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. if they weren’t willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. the president did nothing. with respect to north korea, the real story: we had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in north korea. secretary bill perry negotiated that under president clinton. and we knew where the fuel rods were. and we knew the limits on their nuclear power. colin powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the north koreans. the president reversed it publicly while the president of south korea was here. and the president of south korea went back to south korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. and for two years, this administration didn’t talk at all to north korea. while they didn’t talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. and today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of north korea. that happened on this president’s watch. now, that, i think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.

5438,GEORGE W.

",1,False
5440,KERRY,"well, i’ll tell you exactly why not, but i first want to say something about those sanctions on iran. only the united states put the sanctions on alone, and that’s exactly what i’m talking about. in order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the british, french and germans and other countries. and that’s the difference between the president and me. and there, again, he sort of slid by the question. now, with respect to darfur, yes, it is a genocide. and months ago, many of us were pressing for action. i think the reason that we’re not saying send american troops in at this point is severalfold. number one, we can do this through the african union, providing we give them the logistical support. right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. we need to do more than that. they’ve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. and that’s going to require more than is on the table today. i also believe that it is — one of the reasons we can’t do it is we’re overextended. ask the people in the armed forces today. we’ve got guards and reserves who are doing double duties. we’ve got a backdoor draft taking place in america today: people with stop-loss programs where they’re told you can’t get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. so this is the way the president has overextended the united states. that’s why, in my plan, i add two active duty divisions to the united states army, not for iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. i also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. and if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. but i’ll tell you this, as president, if it took american forces to some degree to coalesce the african union, i’d be prepared to do it because we could never allow another rwanda. it’s a moral responsibility for us and the world.

5442,GEORGE W. BUSH,"back to iran, just for a second. it was not my administration that put the sanctions on iran. that happened long before i arrived in washington, d.c. in terms of darfur, i agree it’s genocide. and colin powell so stated. we have committed $200 million worth of aid. we’re the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. we will commit more over time to help. we were very much involved at the u.n. on the sanction policy of the bashir government in the sudan. prior to darfur, ambassador jack danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the sudan. i agree with my opponent that we shouldn’t be committing troops. we ought to be working with the african union to do so — precisely what we did in liberia. we helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the african union came, we moved them out. my hope is that the african union moves rapidly to help save lives. and fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.

5458,GEORGE W.

5734,MCCAIN,"well, let me just follow up, my friends. if we had done what senator obama wanted done in iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which general petraeus, our chief — chairman of our joint chiefs of staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for america, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, iranian influence would have increased, al qaeda would have re- established a base. there was a lot at stake there, my friends. and i can tell you right now that senator obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. i’ll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. the united states of america, tom, is the greatest force for good, as i said. and we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. but it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. that requires a cool hand at the tiller. this requires a person who understands what our — the limits of our capability are. we went in to somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be — excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. in lebanon, i stood up to president reagan, my hero, and said, if we send marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? and said we shouldn’t. unfortunately, almost 300 brave young marines were killed. so you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you’re sending america’s most precious asset, american blood, into harm’s way. and, again, i know those situations. i’ve been in them all my life. and i can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation’s security. and i may have to make those tough decisions. but i won’t take them lightly. and i understand that we have to say never again to a holocaust and never again to rwanda. but we had also better be darn sure we don’t leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.

5770,OBAMA,"well, the resurgence of russia is one of the central issues that we’re going to have to deal with in the next presidency. and for the most part i agree with senator mccain on many of the steps that have to be taken. but we can’t just provide moral support. we’ve got to provide moral support to the poles and estonia and latvia and all of the nations that were former soviet satellites. but we’ve also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. and some say that that’s what putin intended in the first place. the other thing we have to do, though, is we’ve got to see around the corners. we’ve got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. you know, back in april, i put out a statement saying that the situation in georgia was unsustainable because you had russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. and you knew that if the russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against georgia, that that was not a stable situation. so part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. we haven’t been doing enough of that. we tend to be reactive. that’s what we’ve been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. that’s part of what happened in afghanistan, where we rushed into iraq and senator mccain and president bush suggested that it wasn’t that important to catch bin laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly. we’ve got to be much more strategic if we’re going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there. and one last point i want to make about russia. energy is going to be key in dealing with russia. if we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. that will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like georgia.

5787,MR. NIXON,"well first of all, i don’t agree with senator kennedy that cuba is lost and certainly china was lost when this administration came into power in 1953. as i look at cuba today, i believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the organization of american states. now senator kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part – or alleged part – in what has happened in cuba. he points to the fact that i visited cuba while mr. batista was in power there. i can only point out that if we are going to judge the administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we’re glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. there were eleven dictators in south america and in central america when we came in, in 1953. today there are only three left including the one in cuba. we think that’s pretty good progress. senator kennedy also indicated with regard to cuba that he thought that i had made a mistake when i was in cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. now i’m very surprised that senator kennedy, who is on the foreign relations committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. as a matter of fact in his book, the strategy for peace, he took the right position. and that position is that the united states has a treaty – a treaty with all of the organization of american states – which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. for me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh – opposition to that treaty. now with regard to cuba, let me make one thing clear. there isn’t any question but that we will defend our rights there. there isn’t any question but that we will defend guantanamo if it’s attacked. there also isn’t any question but that the free people of cuba – the people who want to be free – are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. no, cuba is not lost, and i don’t think this kind of defeatist talk by senator kennedy helps the situation one bit.

5789,MR. KENNEDY,"in the first place i’ve never suggested that cuba was lost except for the present. in my speech last night i indicated that i thought that cuba one day again would be free. where i’ve been critical of the administration’s policy, and where i criticized mr. nixon, was because in his press conference in havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- batista dictatorship – that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand cubans in seven years. secondly, i did not criticize him for not calling for free elections. what i criticized was the failure of the administration to use its great influence to persuade the cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. thirdly, arthur gardner, a republican ambassador, earl smith, a republican ambassador, in succession – both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to washington that castro was a marxist, that raul castro was a communist, and that they got no effective results. instead our aid continued to batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively – and today cuba is lost for freedom. i hope some day it will rise; but i don’t think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of latin america – when we’ve almost ignored the needs of latin america; we’ve beamed not a single voice of america program in spanish to all of latin america in the last eight years, except for the three months of the hungarian uh – revolution.

5792,MR. KENNEDY,"mr. morgan, i suggested that if the united states felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets. in my judgment that statement has been distorted uh – by mr. nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions. mr. lodge, on “meet the press” a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the u-2 incident. the u-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security. but they were not in accordance with international law. and i said that i felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue – in fact, i believe mr. nixon himself said on may fifteenth that the flights would continue even though mr. herter testified before the senate foreign relations committee that they had been canceled as of may twelfth – that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful – and i believe it is. the point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to castro this winter; that we expressed regrets – the eisenhower administration expressed regrets – for a flight over southern russia in 1958. we expressed regrets for a flight over eastern germany under this administration. the soviet union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the bering sea incident. the chinese communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956. that is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of theodore roosevelt: be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly. i believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action. it’s not appeasement. it’s not soft. i believe we should be stronger than we now are. i believe we should have a stronger military force. i believe we should increase our strength all over the world. but i don’t confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told – which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards – it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.

5794,MR. NIXON,"i think kenne- senator kennedy is wrong on three counts. first of all, he’s wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that mr. khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. he knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn’t the reason that he broke up the conference. second, he’s wrong in the analogies that he makes. the united states is a strong country. whenever we do anything that’s wrong, we can express regrets. but when the president of the united states is doing something that’s right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including mr. khrushchev. now in that connection senator kennedy has criticized the president on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference – or immediately before the summit conference occurred. this seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. we all remember pearl harbor. we lost three thousand american lives. we cannot afford an intelligence gap. and i just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. i don’t intend to see to it that the united states is ever in a position where, while we’re negotiating with the soviet union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. and i don’t intend ever to express regrets to mr. khrushchev or anybody else if i’m doing something that has the support of the congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the united states.

5799,MR. KENNEDY,"well, mr. nixon hasn’t discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the supreme court decision of 1954? giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question. secondly, what’s he going to do to provide fair employment? he’s been the head of the committee on government contracts that’s carried out two cases, both in the district of columbia. he has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color. nor has he indicated that he will support title three, which would give the attorney general additional powers to protect constitutional rights. these are the great questions: equality of education in school. about two percent of our population of white people are – is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population. sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school. these are the questions in these areas that the north and south, east and west are entitled to know. what will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment? equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president’s pen. what will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the united states? those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership. and i can assure you that if i’m elected president we will do so.

5803,MR. NIXON,"senator kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which i think all americans would share who want some problem – some progress in this area. but let’s look at the performance. when he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time. let me s- look also at what i did. i selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it. now the senator referred to the committee on government contracts. and yet that very committee of which i am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven’t had an adequate staff. now in the special session of congress and also in the session that preceded it, the democratic congress – in which there’s a two-to-one democratic majority – was asked by the president to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, and in the special session in which senator kennedy was calling the signals, along with senator johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the congress already knew what it had before it. all that i can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes. what we need is action. and in the field of executive leadership, i can say that i believe it’s essential that the president of the united states not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.

5806,MR. NIXON,"mr. morgan, no matter how well we’re doing in the cold war, we’re not doing as well as we should. and that will always be the case as long as the communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh – tendencies that they presently are following. now as far as the present situation is concerned, i think it’s time that we nail a few of these distortions about the united states that have been put out. first of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low. senator kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again. i would suggest that after premier kush- khrushchev’s uh – performance in the united nations, compared with president eisenhower’s eloquent speech, that at the present time communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and american prestige is at an all-time high. now that, of course, is just one factor, but it’s a significant one. when we look, for example, at the vote on the congo. we were on one side; they were on the other side. what happened? there were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. look at the votes in the united nations over the past seven and a half years. that’s a test of prestige. every time the united states has been an one side and they’ve been on the other side, our position has been sustained. now looking to what we ought to do in the future. in this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it. it’s being fought primarily in asia, in africa, and in latin america. what do we need? what tools do we need to fight us? well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area. now senator kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate voice of america program for latin america. i’d like to point out that in the last six years, the democratic congresses, of which he’d been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the voice of america programs. they also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. they also have cut two billion dollars off of defense. now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. so let me summarize by saying this: i’m not satisfied with what we’re doing in the cold war because i believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. it must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological. but we’ve got to get help from the congress in order to do this.

5808,MR. KENNEDY,"of course mr. nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the congress has not provided more funds in fact than the president recommended for national defense. nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses. i was responsible for the amendment with senator monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces. the congress of the united states appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the president was willing to use up till a week ago. secondly, on the question of our position in the united nations. we all know about the vote held this week – of the five neutralists – and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the united states. thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of red china into the united nations. last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it. we have not maintained our position and our prestige. a gallup poll taken in february of this year asking the – in eight out of nine countries – they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the soviet union would be by 1970. governor rockefeller has been far more critical in june of our position in the world than i have been. the rockefeller brothers report, general ridgway, general gavin, the gaither report, various reports of congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- united states both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially – the relative strength of the so- of united states compared to that of the soviet union and the chinese communists together – has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the american people should be told the facts.

5813,MR. NIXON,"senator kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance. this is important. but it’s also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation. we need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies. we also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as america moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries. we must associate ourselves with their aspirations. we must let them know that the great american ideals – of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress – that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody. this we must get across to the world. and we can’t do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the congress, adequate funds for technical assistance. the other point that i would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the united states must not rest its case here alone. this is primarily an ideological battle – a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men. we must not meet the communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism. we must stand for our ideals.

5844,MR.

5897,MR. CARTER,"barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. at one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. there is no doubt that we have seen in recent years – in recent months – additional acts of violence against jews in france and, of course, against those who live in israel, by the plo and other terrorist organizations. ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. both i and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. in countries like libya or iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. when governor reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. and recently when he was asked specifically about iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. this ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it’s part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.

5903,MR. REAGAN,"barbara, you’ve asked that question twice. i think you ought to have at least one answer to it. i have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. now, this comes from an answer that i’ve made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when i am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there? and i said, well, yes. and i think that anyone that’s seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that? these are just ideas of what i would think of if i were in that position and had access to the information, and which i would know all the options that were open to me. i have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas? first of all, i would be fearful that i might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, i think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don’t say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you’re thinking of doing. your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they’re coming home soon, or that might cause them harm. what i do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over – we’ve endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now – then, i think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about – what arrangements were made? and i would suggest that congress should hold such an investigation. in the meantime, i’m going to continue praying that they’ll carne home.

5906,MR. REAGAN,"the degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, i should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. and we’ve been guilty of that. because someone didn’t meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. i think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we’re maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all – the soviet union. now, there was a second phase in the iranian affair in which we had something to do with that. and that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did – either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.

5919,MR. CARTER,"yes. governor reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. he not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty – and i don’t know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form – but he also advocates the possibility, he said it’s been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the soviet union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the soviet union. if president brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three american presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it’s obvious that i, as president, and all americans, would reject such a proposition. this would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. it would be very disturbing to american people. it would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the second world war, with al presidents, democratic and republican. and it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. in addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the soviet union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly. this attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it’s said with a quiet voice.

5923,MR. CARTER,"i think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we’re talking about. i had a discussion with my daughter, amy, the other day, before i came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. she said she thought nuclear weaponry – and the control of nuclear arms. this is a formidable force. some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion. if you put 50 tons of tnt in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of tnt – a trainload of tnt stretching across this nation. that’s one major war explosion in a warhead. we have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of tnt warheads. the control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a president, and to cast out this commitment of all presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.

6128,DUKAKIS,"and i would agree that integrity is not a republican or a democratic issue; it’s an american issue. but here again, i don’t know which george bush i’m listening to. wasn’t this the george bush that supported mr. meese? called james watt an excellent secretary of the interior? provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of robert bork to the supreme court of the united states. we’ve had dozens we’ve had dozens and dozens of officials in this administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted. this isn’t the kind of administration we need. and one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we’ll set, is because it tells the american people in advance of the election just what kind of people we’re looking for. i picked lloyd bentsen. mr. bush picked dan quayle. i think that says a great deal to the american people about the standards we’ll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our administration.

6130,DUKAKIS,"28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, i came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch john kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the united states, right here in los angeles. i never dreamed that some day i would win that nomination and be my party’s nominee for president. that’s america. that’s why i’m proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country. 26 days from today you and millions of americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the united states. our opponents say, things are okay. don’t rock the boat. not to worry. they say we should be satisfied. but i don’t think we can be satisfied when we’re spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when mr. bush’s prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich. we can do better than that. not working with government alone, but all of us working together. lloyd bentsen and i are optimists, and so are the american people. and we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of november so we can move forward in the future. kitty and i are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you’ve given to us in your homes and communities all across this country. we love you, and we’re grateful to you for everything that you’ve given to us. and we hope that we’ll be serving you in the white house in january of 1989. thank you, and god bless you.
